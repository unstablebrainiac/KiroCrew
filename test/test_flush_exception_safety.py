"""Exception safety of the deferred-note flush, at every seam that calls it.

``slot.flush_deferred_notes()`` is called at three seams. Every one of them is a
bare statement whose *following* code is what frees the slot, so a raise inside
the flush does not merely delay a held note -- it skips that cleanup:

* ``_start_next_queued_turn`` -- the successor turn is never dispatched.
* ``_finish_queue_cycle`` -- ``append("done")`` / ``chat_done`` never run, so
  ``slot.task`` stays non-None and the UI spinner never clears.
* the bulk-cleanup close path -- the slot has already been ``pop``ed from
  ``state._slots`` and the archive save below is skipped, so the transcript is
  lost outright.

Separately, ``flush_deferred_notes`` clears its backing list before writing, so
a raise part-way through the write loop loses every not-yet-written note.

The existing flush coverage (``test_gateway_appkit_endpoints.py``,
``test_chat_runner_coverage.py``) asserts flush *ordering* only -- no test
anywhere makes the flush, or a note write inside it, raise.
