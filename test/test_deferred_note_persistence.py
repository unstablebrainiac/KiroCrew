"""Deferred-note hold durability.

``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/note`` accepts a note while a turn is running and
replies ``200`` with ``visibleDeferred: true`` — a delivery promise for a
transcript line. Before the fix both halves of the hold lived in memory only
(``_ChatSlot._deferred_notes``), so a gateway restart between the 200 and the
next turn silently voided the promise.

What these tests pin, per the issue's regression gates:

(a) a note accepted mid-turn survives a persistence round-trip: persist →
    fresh slot restore → the first flush delivers exactly one copy, and once
    the save that commits the delivered rows lands, a second restart
    re-delivers nothing;
(b) the durable copy is retired by the SAVE that commits the delivered rows —
    atomically, in the same file write — never by the flush itself, so a crash
    between flush and save re-delivers (at-least-once) instead of losing the
    acknowledged note (loss would void the 200's promise; a repeat does not);
(c) the 200 is not returned before the durable write lands: a failed or
    unreadable-record write rolls the hold back (by identity, never equality)
    and answers a retryable 503 instead of a 200 that lies about durability;
(d) restore is a trust boundary: persisted notes are sanitized and capped at
    ``MAX_DEFERRED_NOTES``, a note without an authorization session is dropped
    rather than delivered unconditionally, and a malformed context half is
    dropped alone (poison-pill prevention) while the visible line survives.
