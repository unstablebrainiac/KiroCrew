"""An app's tools are advertised only while the app is enabled.

The nine tools of the ``apps`` domain under :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_tools` reach
four built-in apps -- Issue Radar, Dev Fleet, Ops Mission Control and Design
Tweak -- whose gateway routes refuse a call with HTTP 403 while the app is
disabled (Dev Fleet's routes and the app reverse proxy Design Tweak sits behind
name the refusal ``app_not_enabled``, Ops Mission Control ``app_disabled``,
Issue Radar carries no code). ``tools/list`` therefore omits a tool while its
app is disabled: a session with none of the apps enabled sees none of them,
instead of tools that can only refuse.

The listing and the call must agree from ONE predicate: the ``installed.json``
reader in :mod:`kiro_crew.apps.manager` that every one of those routes consults.
These tests write real ``installed.json`` records into the isolated test home
rather than stubbing the reader, so what is pinned is the agreement itself.
