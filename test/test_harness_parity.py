"""Structural pins for the harness-parity invariants.

Kiro Crew drives one first-class harness, ``kiro-cli``, and adapts the others.
Each test here closes one invariant from
``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md`` by its id, so a change that
degrades the Kiro path goes red here rather than at an operator's first message.

Two invariants (H13, H14) are properties of a *change* rather than of a tree and
have no deterministic form; they are carried by the ``harness-parity`` rule in
``AUTOSDE.yaml``. The added-line half of H5 lives in
``scripts/check_harness_parity.py`` and is exercised by its ``--test`` mode,
which :func:`test_added_line_gate_self_test_passes` runs.

# a per-host question correctly for the hosts it was written against,
# from an identity test or from "is this host on the shared runtime", while a
# membership table already holds the answer. Every one of them read correctly with
# kiro and KAS and answered wrongly for the third host the moment one arrived --
# steer advertised then met with ``-32601``, a configured effort silently dropped,
# an empty model picker, an entitlement probe that could not heal the snapshot it
# exists for.
#
# So this section is a COMPLETENESS gate rather than another per-site pin. It has
# two halves, and the second is what makes it a gate:
#

#      A host that is not on the runtime today still goes through the answer, so a
#      divergence is caught before that host is ever admitted.
#   2. Every backend-identity comparison in the runtime-path modules must be
#      DECLARED below with a reason. A new one goes red until its author either
#      points it at a table or records why identity is the honest answer there.
#
