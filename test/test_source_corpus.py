"""The corpus behind every AST ratchet: not stale, not empty, not narrowing.

``source_corpus`` makes the whole-tree gates cheap two ways -- it reads the tree
once and caches it, and it parses only the files whose text can possibly match
the calling gate's pattern. Both are silent failure modes: a cache that comes
back empty, or a literal filter that is not actually a necessary condition,
leaves every one of those gates green while seeing nothing. Neither shows up as a
failure anywhere else, which is why they are pinned here rather than trusted.

The cache is pinned by shape, and each filter two ways: its literals must still
appear in the very source the gate exists to reject (so a renamed chokepoint
breaks this test instead of quietly emptying that gate), and it must still
exclude a real part of the tree (so a filter that has stopped narrowing is
noticed rather than paid for).

On soundness of the filters themselves: for the identifier-based ones the
argument is textual. ``_batch_blocks`` fires only on an ``ast.Attribute`` spelled
``batched_save``, and no such node can be parsed from text that does not contain
those characters; the same holds for ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` and for the
``redact*`` family. The keyword-based one is the exception worth stating: an
``ast.AsyncFunctionDef`` needs the ``async`` KEYWORD, but not the two-word string
``async def`` -- ``async  def f():`` parses -- which is why the blocking gate
filters on the bare keyword and why that spelling is asserted below.

The module's other half, ``repo_files``, is pinned the same way and for the same
reason, plus one more: a repo-WIDE scan written as ``rglob``/``os.walk`` sees
every gitignored tree and every nested checkout under the repo root, and it stays
GREEN while doing so. That answer was written correctly once, as a local inside
one gate, and three later gates re-derived the walk instead. So the last class
here is a ratchet: no test may enumerate the checkout from the filesystem.
