"""Process-level resources are per RUNTIME, and the scope says which runtime.

A transient scope carries no identity of its own: systemd auto-names it
``run-u<N>.scope``, so a reader holding a scope -- the slice OOM report, an
operator reading ``systemctl --user list-units`` -- can name the victim directory
and nothing else. One scope holds one spawn and one spawn is one agent runtime,
which may serve several sessions, so that missing name is exactly the step
between "a scope died" and "these sessions died". These tests pin the naming that
supplies it, and pin the two properties that must survive it: every existing
caller's argv is unchanged, and a naming defect can never cost a spawn its
ceiling.

They also pin the unit of state of the resources the ownership audit found being
treated as per-session, so the docstrings describing them cannot drift back: the
cli.json overlay is keyed by work directory, and the kiro-cli chat log by process.
