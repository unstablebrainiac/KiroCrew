# ACP Client Module

## Overview

The primary ACP session transport path spans **five** entry modules: the legacy per-session client (`acp/client.py`, one subprocess per session), the multiplexed runtime (`acp/runtime.py`, one subprocess fanned out to N sessions), the per-session handle (`acp/session_handle.py`, one `sessionId` + queue + prompt/approve/reject loop), a shared dispatch parser (`acp/_dispatch.py`, pure frame-shaping/redaction helpers all paths route through), and the session provider (`acp/session_provider.py`, `AcpSessionProvider` adapting an `AcpSessionHandle` to the `LLMProvider` ABC so runtime-backed sessions are interchangeable with `AcpClient`). All are JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio for a registry-selected ACP harness, managing subprocess lifecycle, session initialization, prompt streaming, and tool permissions. Protocol constants live in `acp/types.py`; the complete backend and host-capability matrix is in [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md#column-meaning).

Module-level code moved out of the two transports lives in the owner modules
below: `acp/runtime_start.py` serves the runtime alone, the five host adapters
serve the client alone, and the rest serve both.
`acp/client.py` and `acp/runtime.py` keep every moved name readable and patchable
under its old path: a moved name their own code reads and nothing patches is an
ordinary import, and every other moved name is forwarded, so a patch through the
old path lands on the owner, where the owner's own callers read it. The moved
process-tree and session-start helpers read the modules they probe with
(`platform_compat`, `sys`, `Path`, `subprocess`, `os`, `time`, `weakref`) and the
two session-handle names the start collector uses from the facade their code came
from, imported when the helper runs, so a rebinding on the old module still reaches
them. A moved exception class keeps `kiro_crew.acp.client` as its `__module__`, so
error chains and tracebacks still name the path callers import it from.

| Owner | Owns |
|---|---|
| `acp/transport_framing.py` | stdio JSON-RPC framing: the oversize-line drain, the no-progress bound on request, response and notification writes, and the failure-path stderr settle (`settle_drain`) |
| `acp/transport_errors.py` | the `AcpError` family and the reading of a harness failure: the stderr, auth, throttle and sandbox classifiers, `classify_provider_error`, and the text and retry verdict `_format_acp_error` / `_raise_acp_error` produce |
| `acp/runtime_models.py` | the advertised model catalog: `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `model_is_unusable`, `resolve_usable_model`, `resolve_pin_spelling`, `resolve_pin_spelling_on`, `pick_served_default`, the model-substitution advisory |
| `acp/runtime_process_tree.py` | descendant enumeration, child identity capture, the escaped-child sweep and RSS-tree measurement |
| `acp/runtime_start.py` | cold-start admission, `SessionStartGate` / `StartPermit`, `StartCollector` and the session-start timeouts |
| `acp/launch.py` | the launch tail both drivers hand their plan to (`launch`): pod bundle swap, scratch window, sandbox wrap with the host's credential mask, cgroup scope, the child's environment and the suspended spawn; plus what several per-process hosts share before it -- the Node-adapter and self-served binary ladders, the resolution-cache generation fence, the enforced-host preflight and the read-back child plumbing |
| `acp/harness/{claude,opencode,goose,pi,deepseek}.py` | one `ProcessAdapter` per host the client starts one process per session for (`process_adapter_for`): its binary resolution and caches, argv and labels, credential mask, gate sealing and routing read-back, and its additions to the child's environment |

`AcpClient`, `AcpRuntime` and `AcpSessionHandle` stay in their modules, as do
kiro-cli and codex-acp executable resolution, kiro-cli's own spawn arm,
`finish_suspended_spawn`, everything after the process exists, and the model-push
ladder (`_push_model_via_effort_split`, `_is_config_value_rejection`) in
`acp/client.py`.

New module-level code goes to the owner whose row above names its
responsibility, not to `acp/client.py` or `acp/runtime.py`: stdio framing and
write bounds to `acp/transport_framing.py`; an `AcpError` subclass, or a
classifier that reads a harness failure into one, to `acp/transport_errors.py`;
model-catalog rules to `acp/runtime_models.py`; process-tree inspection to
`acp/runtime_process_tree.py`; session-start admission to
`acp/runtime_start.py`; a step of the launch both drivers take to `acp/launch.py`;
one host's launch knowledge to that host's adapter under `acp/harness/`. A moved
name a test patches through its facade is
forwarded in `_EXPORTS_BY_OWNER`, which `test_acp_refactor_facade.py` pins.

## Native skill startup views

Native CLI launches prepare a `skill_projection` after the existing spec freshness
check. The alias preserves the prompt, approval policy and non-skill resources,
while Crew retains the authored skill mapping for scoped discovery. A workspace
CLI overlay suppresses implicit native resource inheritance; explicit steering and
AGENTS.md resources preserve enabled inheritance. Aliases are excluded from Crew's
agent roster, translated on `session/set_mode`, and normalized in incoming mode and
agent-name fields. The original agent name remains the Crew session identity.
Both the direct client and multiplexed runtime apply the same preparation.
Projection defaults to enabled. Set `KIROCREW_NATIVE_SKILL_PROJECTION=0` in the
Crew process environment and restart Crew's native sessions to roll back to
authored native agents. Disabled launches restore the Crew-owned inheritance
overlay before spawning and bypass alias translation and projected search
requirements. A spawn-time ceiling takes the same fallback automatically: when
the agents directory already holds `SKILL_VIEW_PROJECTION_CEILING` (2,000, the
constant the doctor's backlog warning also reads) or more
`kirocrew-skill-view-*.json` files, a fresh preparation stops minting new views
and runs the authored agent, so a regression that reopens the leak cannot deepen
it. The count is the raw total of alias files, including those another Crew home
sharing the agents directory wrote, because kiro-cli reads every one at startup
regardless of owner; the doctor names the foreign-home case and its move remedy.
The ceiling gates only the spawn-time path (preparation that did not specify
`enabled`); an explicit `enabled=True` -- the warm `set_mode` refresh of an
already-projected live session -- is always honored so the ceiling never aborts a
running session, which means a session that began below the ceiling keeps
refreshing its own view. On the ceiling-tripped fallback the existing per-spawn
prune still runs, so this home's own backlog can drain back below the ceiling
without a restart; the `KIROCREW_NATIVE_SKILL_PROJECTION=0` disable path does not
prune. Existing governance, sandbox and signed-session identity checks
still apply. The switch is latched at spawn; mode changes in a running projected
process keep projection enabled until restart. Rollback restores native skill
metadata enumeration, so the bounded native startup guarantee no longer applies.
The new alias integration has fixture coverage; an end-to-end native CLI probe
remains outstanding. The enabled default is an explicit rollout decision.
Mapped agents and the default `kirocrew` agent expose the single
`@kirocrew-core/skill_search` tool when the authored tool list does not already
include it. Unmapped custom agents gain no tools or servers and have an empty
discovery scope. The added tool uses the managed server declaration without
adding auto-approval. Native `/agent` mutations are refused with a pointer to Crew's
agent selector, which updates both the native mode and Crew's template binding.
A typed `/agent <name>` never reaches that refusal on Crew's own surfaces: the
dashboard composer, the chat runner (split pane and linked channel threads) and a
Slack thread each switch through Crew instead (`agent_switch_command.py`; the
runner and the picker's route share `chat_handlers.switch_slot_agent`).
Read-only native agent listing/schema commands remain available. Mode activation
refreshes the view inside the existing derived-spec freshness bracket.
The reserved core server's command and environment are pinned to the managed
declaration. Explicit search exclusions disable that agent's projected view with an
actionable error. The reserved server's `disabled` must be a boolean and
`disabledTools` a list of strings; null or malformed values fail only that agent
with an actionable error instead of aborting preparation of healthy agents.
Shared runtimes derive session control-plane elements from the
prepared view, then attach the existing signed session token. An existing broker
element wins. Whether the `kirocrew-core` element can be mounted at all is one
question with one predicate, `session_mcp.native_mount_withholding`, asked over
the source set `session_mcp.native_settings_sources` returns: the agent's own
`kirocrew-core` entry, the global `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` the dashboard's
tool toggle writes, and the project's `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. The two
readers split the sources by what each one is. The projection judges the spec
entry at preparation, as authored and before the managed launch replaces it (the
replacement carries only the keys a per-session element can express, so a `type`
or a key the element cannot carry would otherwise vanish unjudged): a restriction
authored there is static for the view's life and refuses that agent's projected
view, naming the spec and the restriction. The settings files are judged at
every session start, because they outlive a spawn and are shared by every agent
of the process, and the mount is their ONE reader: `kiro_control_plane_servers`
reads them once at `session/new` and `session/load`, judges every granted
identity-bound server -- a name a broker stub already carries included, since the
stub carries a kiro-cli-only restriction no better than the element does -- and
returns the array together with the verdicts it withheld on
(`NativeControlPlaneMount`). For a projected search agent whose element the mount
did not produce, the shared runtime refuses that one session on THAT verdict,
with a sentence naming the file, the restriction and the way back (the
dashboard's MCP tab for a toggle); it reads nothing again, because a second read
is the window in which a toggle undone in between answers "allowed" and the
session falls to the generic guard naming the wrong file. The spawn stands, the
other agents' sessions stand, and a toggle undone restores the next session
without a respawn. A broker stub is not a source: its overlay is written once
from the spec and the global file as they were, so a stub written before a toggle
is exactly what the toggle cannot have reached; the files are judged before it is
accepted. Agents outside the projection take the stub path as the mount leaves
it. The direct client (`AcpClient`) mounts no per-session element at all: one
process serves one session, the identity rides the process environment, and
kiro-cli mounts `kirocrew-core` natively from the view -- the managed launch plus
the `autoApprove`, `disabledTools` and `timeout` the view copies -- so the element
question does not arise there, and the projection it prepares
(`per_session_element=False`) keeps a view whose spec restricts other tools
(`disabledTools: ["learn_add"]`, a `timeout`); only `skill_search` itself
disabled or excluded still refuses it. A restriction is a disabled server, a non-empty
`disabledTools`, a transport a user chose that is not stdio, a key the per-session
element cannot carry -- the table the spec rebuild keeps on a managed entry
(`agent._MANAGED_MCP_ENTRY_KEYS`, the one table both share) less `timeout`, which
`acp_server_element` does not emit, so a `timeout` set on the declaration the
element would replace keeps that declaration native rather than run the server on
the default with nothing to say so -- an entry that is not an object, or a settings
file that cannot be read safely. Kiro Crew's own marks on an entry are not
restrictions: the `registry` transport value the rebuild stamps under
`agent.mcp_registry_mode` -- on the agent spec's managed entry while that mode is
on, the one state in which Crew writes it; outside registry mode kiro-cli drops a
marked entry wherever it is declared, so the same value on the spec with the mode
off (a marker the rebuild has not yet removed, or a line someone wrote) and in a
settings file in any state keeps the declaration native like any other non-stdio
type, and the predicate reads the mode itself rather than trusting the
declaration's place -- the `x-kirocrew` provenance
marker the global-file sync stamps and the `x-kirocrew-derived` record the
rebuild writes -- kiro-cli reads none of them as a setting. The way back the
verdict names is the dashboard's MCP tab only for a mute or a `disabledTools` in
the global settings, the one file that tab writes; a restriction in the spec or
the project's file is offered the edit that removes it there. The message repeats at most eight
user-authored values and at most `_NATIVE_NAMED_CHARS` characters of each -- a
name, a key, a transport, the `repr` of a malformed value -- and at most
`_NATIVE_NAMED_PATH_CHARS` characters of a settings file's path, cut from the
front so the tail that locates the file survives, because the message is
retained per agent for the life of the runtime while the file it quotes is read
up to the reader's 50 MB ceiling. Every value and the path go through the
package's one sink cleaner (`mcp_session_report.sanitize_sink_text`: redact,
drop control characters, then cut) before the message repeats them -- the value
is text from a settings file, the project's checked out with the repository,
and the message reaches the gateway's log, where a newline or an escape sequence
in a tool name would write a line of its own. The cleaner reads the first
`_NATIVE_NAMED_WINDOW` characters of a value whole, so nothing the message
repeats was cut before it was redacted and a 50 MB value costs a window, not
the file; a value the window did not hold whole is a cut value. The restriction itself stands, since the mount
never widens the grant. An agent the spec refused is never in the projection's
search set, so the `session/new` refusal to bind `skill_search` without its
native restrictions is unreachable for that shape: the spawn that would load its
view fails as `AcpRuntimeError` carrying the projection's sentence, the error the
provider's startup paths translate; a session refused for a
settings file names the file instead of that guard, and the guard remains for
what it was written for: an element neither granted nor pre-empted while the
files allow it.

The workspace overlay owns `chat.disableInheritingDefaultResources=true` while
Crew supplies discovery. Only literal JSON `true` in the original native setting
disables inherited steering/AGENTS files; malformed values such as `"false"` or
`1` preserve those instructions. Rollback still restores the original local value
and key presence unchanged. For an inherited global preference, global changes are
re-read at each launch. A pre-existing local preference is preserved in
`kirocrew.skillDiscovery.inheritFiles`; edit that boolean to change explicit
steering/AGENTS inheritance while retaining the native skill metadata bound.
This overlay also affects standalone native custom agents in that workspace.
The [Kiro CLI 2.10 release notes](https://kiro.dev/changelog/cli/2-10/)
document this setting and agent-config hot reload. No documented per-invocation
settings channel was found; changing `KIRO_HOME` would also relocate native
identity and session state, so it is not used for this overlay. Every in-product
workspace `cli.json` writer—projection, effort, Tool Search, and the built-in
review pool—takes the same verified `.kirocrew-cli-settings.lock` sidecar and
reads the file only after acquiring it. Projection holds that lock from the
fresh read through alias publication and settings commit, so a concurrent writer
cannot be replaced by a stale pre-enumeration snapshot. Lock identity changes or
a two-second acquisition timeout fail closed without writing the settings file.
The lock admits a `.kiro` or `settings` link component by component. It uses
`lstat` and `readlink` only on names already inside the resolved work directory,
then decides containment from the link text before probing the target. A link
naming a remote, outside, other-drive, or looping path is refused without being
opened or resolved. Projection and rollback then read and write the admitted
folder. A clear or Default under a refused link reports that it could not change
the file, whether or not the target contains `cli.json`. A component swapped for
a link after admission is still refused by the pinned walk (see
[providers](providers.md)); an outside link skips projection and logs the existing
refusal.
Crew records the original local inheritance key's presence and value in
`kirocrew.skillDiscovery.previousInheritance`. Rollback restores that snapshot
only while the native key still equals Crew's asserted `true`, removes Crew's
overlay markers and preserves unrelated settings and a native key that the
operator changed or removed. Older overlays use their recorded local/global
source and boolean preference for restoration. Stop projected sessions before
rollback so another active Crew process cannot reassert the shared overlay.
Inactive aliases owned by the same Crew data home are pruned when no projection
in this process holds them and no held lease in any process names them. An
alias is named by a 24-hex digest of the agent name, the owning Crew data home
and the view content, so every spawn from that home that derives the same view
-- any run folder, any session -- publishes the same file, and publication skips
an existing alias that already SAYS the same spec with this home's sidecar: the
two are compared parsed, so a launcher that re-serializes every file in the
agents directory does not force a rewrite of every alias under the shared lock,
while every value, env values included, still counts. Each MCP server env value is in that
digest as a digest of its own, except the values of `volatile_env_keys()`: keys a
launcher re-stamps with a per-launch nonce (default `AIM_CREDS_AGENT_INJECTION`,
extended by `KIROCREW_SKILL_VIEW_VOLATILE_ENV`). Leaving those in would name a new
alias on every spawn, so a changed volatile value reuses the alias and publication
rewrites it with the full view. Every other value counts: a rotated credential
names a NEW alias, one kiro-cli has not loaded, so `set_mode` never activates a
copy still carrying the old credential, and two launch contexts with different
credentials never share an alias. The env keys and the source spec's path are in
the digest too, so two agent files differing only in env values never share an
alias. A launcher nonce under a
key the set does not know shows up as one view per launch; `kirocrew doctor`
names each `<server>.<KEY>` whose value differs across one agent's views
(`census_churning_env_keys`), so the operator can declare it volatile.
The same list governs the worker-spec freshness gate: a change to a volatile value
alone neither ends a worker load (`require_unchanged_derived_spec`) nor re-derives
the `kirocrew-worker.json` mirror. So a key declared volatile must be one the
launcher writes into every agent spec it manages, the worker's included.
Views can still differ per
workspace: a SCOPE_PROJECT agent's prompt path and workspace-local inheritance
shape the view, so those agents get
one alias per workspace. A run's work directory is reclaimed separately (`session_work_dir`),
under ONE invariant: a reclaim decision uses only evidence the deciding process
OWNS -- its session registry for its own runs, and its own data home's pid ledger
(`kiro_session_pids.txt`, reaped at boot by `cleanup_orphaned_sessions`) for a
dead predecessor gateway. It never probes the liveness of a pid another process
wrote to decide a deletion, and it never judges a directory marked by another
data home. The provider factory marks a work directory it DERIVED from an exact
generated one-run key -- `subagent:<16 hex>` from `SubagentManager._mint_agent_id`
(eight hex on the shipped builds whose directories the sweep also recognises),
`cron:<8 hex job>:<8 hex run>` from `build_cron_session_context`, or
`memory-consolidation:<store>:<32 hex>` from `llm_helpers.background_turn`, which
discards the key when the call ends -- never a caller-supplied `cwd`. That key
counts as one-run only where the walk holds `.kiro` open; on the by-name walk
(Windows) its folder is never marked, so neither the shutdown reclaim nor the sweep
removes it, and its name is no sweep candidate. The doctor's census below still
counts it with the unmarked folders, since counting deletes nothing. The key
predicate and corresponding directory-name regex come from one shared shape table;
stable `cron:<job>:<agent>` keys are not one-run directories.
`AcpProvider.start` writes a `.kirocrew-run-dir` marker before
any other writer: two ASCII lines, the data-home identity (`data_home_id()`, the
digest of the resolved `config_dir()`) and the gateway pid. That marker is the
directory's only provenance: a name under the workspace root is not one (a person
can make `subagent_deadbeef` there), and the content of `cli.json` is not one
either, because the projection merges its keys into a file that already exists.
`mark_run_dir` is idempotent for a marker already naming this (home, pid),
replaces one this home's predecessor wrote (one gateway runs per data home, so
that pid is not running), and never touches another home's or an unreadable one
-- the session then continues without a sweepable mark. Marker reads use the same
bounded discipline as agent scratch: links are refused, the no-follow descriptor
must name a regular file no larger than 4 KiB, the home id must be 24 hex digits
and the pid in the kernel range; any other shape keeps the directory.
`AcpProvider.shutdown` removes a marked-by-flag directory only after its client
positively confirms the root and every tracked child exited (`process_tree_confirmed_dead`),
and when it holds only Crew's own residue (`.kiro/settings/` with `cli.json` and
its lock sidecar, plus the marker) and the `.kiro/agents` folder kiro-cli creates
in the folder it starts in, while that folder is empty. On platforms without
descriptor-relative opens (Windows) the by-name walk keeps a tree that holds that
folder, since it cannot pin `.kiro` against a junction swapped in after the check.
The factory flag permits an absent marker on this path, so a refused marker write
never makes the directory unreclaimable; a
present marker must name this data home AND this process exactly, and anything
else refuses. The flag says the directory was derived from a one-run KEY, not
that this instance is the one the registry kept for it, so registration installs
a fail-closed ownership claim on the provider. At final reclaim that claim holds
the session registry lock from the check through the off-loop filesystem
operation; if cancellation arrives mid-reclaim, shutdown waits for that worker
before releasing the claim and then propagates the cancellation. It refuses
while another registered provider names the same key or
cwd, or while an allocation reservation names the key; a successor that has not
registered yet is therefore fenced too, and one beginning after the claim waits
until the old residue is gone before its own start recreates the tree. No
installed claim, or a claim that raises, keeps the directory. Where the registry
already knows a provider lost ownership -- the loser of a cold-start race, a
recycled session whose successor is already registered, or the bootstrap provider
that borrowed a parent's key -- it still calls `disown_work_dir()` first as the
cheaper one-way early exit. Only Crew's residue names are ever unlinked and every
directory goes through `rmdir`, so a run that wrote anything into its cwd keeps
the whole tree. The gateway sweeps `workspace_root()` for what a dead PREDECESSOR
of its own data home left (`sweep_predecessor_work_dirs`): once at boot, after
`cleanup_orphaned_sessions` has reaped the ledger and past `KIROCREW_READY` but
before any session writer starts, and again on the hourly maintenance wake with
the same rule for whatever the bounds left. It reclaims a marked, residue-only
directory only when the marker names this data home, a gateway pid that is not
this process, and a pid the ledger retains no entry for
(`session_pid.retained_gateway_pids`, read under the ledger's lock and never
modifying it -- an entry left after the reap means something of that gateway may
still be alive); it skips any directory a registered provider names and any whose
newest mtime is inside a grace window (a plain extra brake). A marker naming this
process is never the sweep's business, a marker of another data home is never
touched whatever its pid is doing, and an unreadable ledger sweeps nothing. Each
wake is bounded by entries and wall clock, and streams the listing so a root of
any size costs it counters, not a list. Directories older builds left carry no
marker and are never reclaimed automatically; `kirocrew doctor` prints one line
with three figures from one bounded walk judged by the sweep's own rule --
unmarked directories, marked ones this data home cannot reclaim (another home's,
an unreadable marker, or a gateway the ledger still retains), and marked ones the
rule permits yet the sweep keeps for their contents (counted by a read-only
residue probe that mirrors the sweep's keep rule -- the by-name walk keeping
kiro-cli's `.kiro/agents`, or any marked folder that gained a file beyond Crew's
residue) -- resolving the
workspace root without creating it (`workspace_root(create=False)`) so the
read-only report leaves no tree behind on a host where no gateway ever ran, and
naming the manual remedy for an unmarked backlog. The doctor deletes nothing.
Each run caps reclaims at `_PRUNE_MAX_RECLAIMS_PER_RUN` plus the number
of aliases it publishes. Aliases published by builds that predate this lifecycle carry NO
record of either kind, so an ownership-keyed reclaim alone would leave the entire
accumulated backlog on disk and bound only post-upgrade growth -- which is the
per-turn tool-spec cost this exists to remove. Those are reclaimed on a separate
path that does not read a record: the name must match Crew's own prefix plus the
24-hex digest the projection derives, the file must be a projected view (it
renames itself to that alias and carries no `skill://` resource), AND it must
carry one positive mark the projection itself writes -- Crew's managed
`kirocrew-core` server entry, or the absolute steering resource pointing at this
host's kiro home. A matching NAME alone never authorizes removal, and neither
does shape: an unlink is not undoable and an operator's own agent could in
principle carry that name, so an unrecorded view Crew cannot positively claim is
left alone. That is a smaller reclaim than the name shape would allow and the
right side to err on. That path cannot prove the pair unregenerable, so
its safety rests on the consumer contract instead -- the spawn argv and
`session/set_mode` both re-prepare before they use an alias, and `/agent` is
refused rather than translated -- which makes a removal a cache eviction for a
live pre-upgrade session (its next preparation republishes the same name WITH a
record) and a reclaim for every dead work directory. That contract has exactly
one hole, at the upgrade boundary: a publisher from a build predating the lease
holds no lease, and between its write and kiro-cli reading `--agent` its alias is
indistinguishable from backlog -- and it will NOT re-prepare, having already done
so, making a deletion a failed spawn rather than an eviction. An unrecorded alias
is therefore spared until it is older than a minimum age. That age is NOT a
liveness proxy -- the reason an age cut-off is rejected for the recorded path --
it only has to exceed publish-to-spawn, which is milliseconds, while the backlog
it reclaims is hours to days old; a clock that moved backwards lands on the
sparing side. Because no record exists, a
legacy alias also carries no data-home attribution, so a second Crew home sharing
this agents directory sees the same eviction-then-republish rather than the
home-scoped skip a recorded alias gets. Every other gate still applies to it:
this run's own set, live in-process projections and held leases are all checked
first, and removal is identity-checked against the bytes and inode just read.
The prune runs while the publication lock is held, which is what keeps a
deletion from landing on an alias a publisher that takes the same lock is
writing. What one call bounds is the section it holds, not the pile it works on.
Reclaims, stale-candidate work, and total traversal have separate PER RUN
ceilings. Leases are read by ONE bounded scan per prune, taken before the walk.
A lease is only created under this same lock, so none appears mid-walk; one
released mid-walk (its finalizer takes no lock) still reads as held, which keeps
its aliases one call longer and never frees one early. Candidate discovery
streams the directory under an entry-walk limit: retained aliases do not consume
the stale-work budget, but every directory entry consumes the separately bounded
traversal budget, and skip credit is capped at one work-limit, so padding and a
large live set cannot extend the enumeration. Reaching that limit is logged at
INFO, the same way the lease-scan ceiling is. Classification then runs under
`_PRUNE_MAX_SECONDS_PER_RUN`, a BETWEEN-candidate budget: it limits how many
candidates are walked, not how long any single one takes. It is derived from the
lock's acquisition ceiling -- the ceiling minus the lease scan's budget minus
`_PROJECTION_PUBLICATION_RESERVE_SECS`, the share kept for the publication
writes in the same section -- so retuning the ceiling moves the budget with it.
Reclaims are capped at `_PRUNE_MAX_RECLAIMS_PER_RUN` plus the aliases the call
publishes. That cap is a ceiling and never a floor: a candidate that proves
unreclaimable costs a full classification without counting toward it, so a call
can spend its whole budget and reclaim nothing. Each call starts its walk at an
offset drawn at random into the bounded candidate list, because the workload
spawns a fresh process per run and a remembered cursor would restart at zero
every time; across spawns an entry inside that window is reached with some
probability, never on a schedule, and entries beyond the entry-walk limit stay
deferred while stable padding sits ahead of them, so the ceiling guarantees
bounded entry traversal rather than eventual drain. So one call guarantees a
bounded locked section and at most a capped number of reclaims. No call
guarantees the pile is smaller afterwards. The pile shrinks only while aliases
are reclaimed faster than callers mint new ones, and the mint rate is a property
of the workload -- how often agents are spawned with views that differ -- not of
this code: the budget sets how much work a call may do, not whether that work
outpaces the callers. A gateway-boot drain (`drain_stale_aliases`, reached from
the boot janitor through the `agent_sdk.drivers.acp` seam) runs that same
per-spawn prune under the publication lock in a loop, pausing between batches
for longer than the lock's poll cap so a waiting spawn can take the lock. A
batch that cannot take the lock counts as one that reclaimed nothing. It stops
after `_DRAIN_IDLE_BATCHES` consecutive batches that reclaim nothing, each from
a fresh start offset, or at `_DRAIN_MAX_BATCHES`, and it removes what those
batches reach; it does not promise an empty directory. A reclaim
the filesystem itself refuses -- a read-only mount, an agents directory this
process cannot write -- is reported as a warning naming the directory, the
operation and the errno, at most once per interval with the count of refusals
it stands for; only `EACCES`, `EPERM` and `EROFS` are diagnosed as an unwritable
directory, and any other errno (`ENOENT` from a concurrent prune elsewhere,
`EMFILE`) is reported by name with no such diagnosis. Every other `False`
from the unlink is a deliberate keep and stays at debug.

Threads of one process do not race the publication file lock on their own
clocks. `_projection_alias_lock` first takes an in-process `threading.Lock` per
agents directory (`_in_process_projection_lock`, waited on for at most
`_IN_PROCESS_PROJECTION_WAIT_SECS`, 30 s, then an `OSError`), so the file lock's
two-second `_PROJECTION_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS` measures cross-process contention
only; before this a burst of session starts in one gateway timed the later ones
out and they started without their skill view though no other process held the
lock. Queued starts pay for each other's locked sections in turn, so the
per-spawn prune is throttled: `prepare_native_skill_projection` runs it at most
once per `_PER_SPAWN_PRUNE_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS` (5 s) per agents directory per
process (`_per_spawn_prune_due`, decided under the lock). The boot drain prunes
on its own schedule and is not throttled.

`session/set_mode` never activates a copy of an agent older than the one just
prepared. kiro-cli 2.25.0 and 2.26.0 do not reload their agents directory on the
rename that publishes an alias (fixed upstream in kiro-team/kiro-cli#5026), so a
NEW alias published after the process started can answer `Mode '<alias>' not found`
while the file is on disk. The bracket re-prepares before `set_mode` and always
sends the FRESH alias: an alias the host loaded earlier, the spawn one included,
may hold a generation of the spec an edit has since removed a server or an
auto-approval from, and so may the authored spec kiro-cli cached, which it does
not reload on a rename either. A `Mode ... not found` naming that alias -- and
nothing else -- is retried after `_PROJECTED_MODE_RETRY_DELAYS_SECS` (3 s in
total), each retry preceded by `announce_alias`: a same-bytes in-place rewrite of
that alias, a data write kiro-cli's watcher DOES reload on (a miss triggers no
reload by itself). If the host still has not loaded it, the session start FAILS
with an error naming the agent and saying to restart the gateway; no other copy
is activated in its place. A re-preparation that could not run (the alias lock is
busy) fails the start the same way, since nothing proves any alias still matches
the spec.

Overlapping starts on one runtime are ordered so the newest view always wins. A
preparation reads the agent specs before it waits on the alias file lock, so
without ordering a start that read a spec before an edit revoked a grant could
return last and activate that alias. Preparation and adoption therefore run under
a per-runtime asyncio lock (`_skill_projection_lock`), so specs are read in
adoption order, and each adopted projection is stamped with a generation issued
under that lock; adoption refuses one older than the adopted generation. The lock
covers only the `to_thread` preparation and the in-memory adoption, never
`set_mode` itself, so a slow MCP server boot on one start does not hold up the
others. Instead, a start whose `set_mode` is pending re-checks the generation
before every attempt (it sends the newest adopted view's alias, never its own
older one, and fails if that view does not offer the agent) and after the
answer, after first taking the lock so a preparation still running when the
answer arrived is adopted before the check: if a newer view gave the agent a
different alias while the request was in flight, the host may have activated the
older one, so the session is terminated
and the start fails with "start it again; if it keeps failing, restart the
gateway". A newer view that leaves the agent's alias unchanged refuses nothing.
A preparation whose start is cancelled still runs to completion under the lock
and its view is adopted before the cancellation propagates. A newer preparation
that yields no view (or raises) leaves pending starts unable to prove their view
current, so they fail the same way until a later view is adopted.
Lock order, outermost first: `_skill_projection_lock` -> the alias file lock ->
the workspace `cli.json` settings lock -> the projection lease. The file locks
are taken and released inside one synchronous call on a worker thread, which
never waits on the asyncio lock, so the two cannot deadlock.

The adopted projection keeps translating, in inbound frames, every alias an
earlier projection of the process published (`recognise`: alias-shaped names
mapped to admissible agent names only, spawn aliases first, at most
`_RECOGNISED_ALIASES_MAX`, with one warning per projection past the bound), and
the projection the process spawned with is held for its life as
`_spawn_skill_projection` so those aliases stay out of the prune. In
`availableModes` a projected agent stays listed when the host advertises any of
its aliases OR its authored id, once, so an agent never vanishes from later
session starts because its alias changed. Each outcome logs and counts
`kirocrew.acp.skill_view.fallback`; any other error propagates as before.

An alias view leaves out `welcomeMessage` and caps `description` at
`_ALIAS_DESCRIPTION_MAX_CHARS`. kiro-cli copies every loaded spec's name,
description, source and welcomeMessage into each `session/new` and `session/load`
reply, and an alias is a second copy of an agent the host already lists. So
duplicating that text only doubles the reply, and past the ACP readers' 10 MB
frame limit the reply is dropped: 50 agents carrying 113 KB of release notes each
reached 11.7 MB. Kiro Crew renders an agent's welcomeMessage from the authored
spec, never from an alias. A preparation also warns, once per size, naming each
authored spec whose display text passes `_DISPLAY_TEXT_WARN_BYTES` and the
directory total past `_DISPLAY_TEXT_TOTAL_WARN_BYTES`. That text still reaches
every reply from the authored copy, so the fix for it is at its source.

The strict resolver (`NativeSkillProjection.agent`, used by `session/set_mode`)
refuses any name it never projected, so an agent cannot switch to a mode outside
the scope it launched under. Two seams around it must not open a hole. First, a
spec `list_agents` enumerated and read is projected or, if a validation branch
refuses it, RECORDED AS A REFUSAL (`errors`, under its name), never silently
skipped. An agent in no projected map is the no-view case: `spawn_agent` returns
its own authored name so it spawns rather than aborting a spawn over a skill view
it never asked for -- the issue's fix -- while the strict `agent` still refuses a
mid-session switch to any mode this view never prepared. Second, the launched
agent's OWN
activation must not be refused because the process is already running as it even
with no prepared view -- but this is scoped to session START, not mid-session
switches, and the two spawn paths handle it differently. The shared runtime hosts
MANY sessions and allows activating `self._agent` at EVERY session-start bracket
(`_activate_mode_bracketed`), keyed on `self._agent` (`_resolve_start_alias`); it
does NOT set
`spawn_agent_name`, because that field also makes `request()` -- the general
outbound path a mid-session `set_mode` takes -- tolerate the launch agent
indefinitely. The direct client is one process / one session: it sets
`spawn_agent_name`, its `request()` tolerates the launched agent's FIRST
`set_mode` and then clears it, so a later mid-session switch back to it takes the
strict resolver again and fails closed. The general (mid-session) `set_mode` path
stays strict for both. The create/load availability gate (`_verify_spawn_agent_active`,
Guard A/A2) compares the session reply's reported mode against the launch agent
`self._agent`; every inbound frame runs through `projection.frame`, which maps a
view ALIAS back to the declared name before the gate reads it, so the plain
comparison accepts a projected agent and a no-view launch agent alike. A genuine
substitution (the backend ran its own default after refusing the spec) matches
NEITHER and still fails closed via `_mode_available` (a backend that advertises no
`modes` list is no evidence of substitution and is admitted; an advertised list
that omits the agent fails closed). Because the start reads the session reply's
`availableModes` BEFORE it sends `set_mode`, `frame` keeps the launched agent's
own mode in projected `availableModes` whenever `advertised_launch_name` is set --
otherwise it would advertise no mode the process could activate and fail the
session open during initialization. That advertising field is set by BOTH spawn
paths (direct client and shared runtime)
and is kept DISTINCT from `spawn_agent_name`: advertising the launch mode at
session open is safe for both runtimes (it only decides what the start can see),
whereas `request()`'s mid-session tolerance stays direct-client-only and strict on
the shared runtime. Unlike `spawn_agent_name`, `advertised_launch_name` is never
consumed -- it describes a fixed launch fact -- and `recognise()` carries it onto a
refreshed projection (frame runs on the current projection, which the shared runtime
adopts mid-session), while still refusing to carry `spawn_agent_name`. A projection
no spawn claimed sets neither field, so an unprojected agent stays hidden.

Projected agent JSON contains only fields accepted by Kiro's strict
schema; lifecycle ownership lives in the non-spec
`.kirocrew-skill-projection-metadata` directory. Each sidecar records the alias's
exact byte digest AND the digest of its identity (the view the alias is named by,
env values out), so a stale or replaced sidecar cannot authorize deletion of a
different spec, while an alias another program merely re-serialized or
re-stamped stays owned. A sidecar written before the identity digest existed,
whose alias bytes moved, is still ownership-checked -- marker, this data home,
the projected-view shape -- and then removed WITH its alias, without the legacy
age wait: every build that writes a sidecar also holds a lease while it uses the
alias; removing the alias alone would strand its sidecar. Two sweeps retire
what outlived an alias, under the same lock, walk limit, random start and time
budget as the alias walk, capped at
`_SIDECAR_SWEEP_MAX_PER_RUN`: this home's sidecars whose alias is gone, and empty
`<alias>.lock` files older than the legacy age with no alias beside them.

A sidecar is also the record a stored view name maps back through
(`source_agent_name`), so no path deletes one before the view ledger
(`view-sources.json`, beside the sidecars) holds its alias -> agent pair. The
orphan sweep records its whole batch in one ledger write, then unlinks, and
the time budget covers both halves; a batch the ledger refuses is kept. The
prune records a window of upcoming candidates the first time a pair needs it;
when the ledger refuses, the alias still goes and the sidecar stays, answering
on its own until a later sweep can record it. The ledger is bounded by
`_VIEW_SOURCES_MAX`. Every write makes its own pairs the newest entries (a pair
already held is rewritten too, so the same write cannot evict it); past the
bound, entries a sidecar still answers for go first, then the oldest retired
names, which stop resolving and are counted in a warning. A full ledger
therefore never stops the sweeps from retiring sidecars. A write the
filesystem refuses keeps every sidecar for the rest of that prune or sweep
without retrying per candidate. This
module never creates the latter; a launcher that rewrites every spec leaves one
per spec it locked. The boot drain counts both sweeps as progress. `kirocrew
doctor` reports the residue and the aliases whose bytes no longer match their
sidecar -- another program is rewriting the directory -- on a `skill-view
residue` line, warning past `_SKILL_VIEW_RESIDUE_WARN` or on any rewrite.

Publication is by rename (`atomic_write`), and kiro-cli -- measured on 2.25.0
and 2.26.0 -- does not reload its agents directory on a rename: its inotify
watch receives `IN_MOVED_TO` but it reloads only on a data write to a `*.json`
name, about 0.6 s debounced. A new alias renamed in after the process started
therefore answers `Mode '<alias>' not found` indefinitely, and an alias renamed
over a known name keeps serving its OLD content. Every publication is
therefore followed by `_announce_publication`, which rewrites the alias's own
bytes in place, unchanged -- a data write the host reloads on, which a racing
reader cannot see torn -- and only while the file still holds exactly those
bytes. That is what lets the `set_mode` retry above land on the published alias
within its budget instead of failing the start.

No released build ever wrote lifecycle fields INTO a spec --
kiro-cli denies unknown fields, so the projection never could -- and an alias
without a sidecar is judged by the unrecorded path above instead. The recorded
source paths are never probed, so untrusted metadata cannot
trigger a filesystem or network lookup. Each live projection publishes one bounded lease in the non-spec
`.kirocrew-skill-projection-leases` directory as TWO files: a `.json` record
naming its aliases, which is never locked, and a `.hold` sidecar that carries the
lock for the projection object's lifetime and is never read. The split is
required, not stylistic: Windows file locks are MANDATORY, so a lock on byte 0 of
the record makes a reader's parse fail with a lock violation from any other
handle, including one in the same process. Pruning always runs while the current
projection holds its own lease, so a single-file lease turned every liveness
probe into the uncertainty answer and reclaimed nothing on Windows while passing
on POSIX, where locks are advisory. Finalization releases the lock and removes
both identity-verified sidecars. Pruning runs ONE bounded lease scan for the whole
run -- not one scan per candidate, which multiplied the candidate cap by the
scan cap into a quadratic sweep under the held publication lock -- streaming lease
records without materializing the directory and stopping at a fixed scan ceiling.
That ceiling bounds how many entries are parsed and lock-probed, not how long a
slow filesystem takes over them, so the scan also reads a between-entry deadline
(`_PROJECTION_LEASE_SCAN_MAX_SECONDS`, 0.4 s, sized like the candidate walk's
budget because both share the two-second lock ceiling with the publication
writes). A spent deadline is handled exactly like the cap.
That single scan produces the set of aliases named by every HELD lease plus one
uncertainty bit; the candidate loop then consults the set with O(1) membership. A
capped, interrupted, or failed scan is uncertain, and any uncertainty authorizes
NO candidate deletion for the entire prune -- a candidate whose covering lease the
scan could not fully see must be treated as live. A stale lease is counted as
reclaimed only once neither its record nor its `.hold` remains, and a record is
kept while its `.hold` could not be removed so the pair is retried whole. A
`.hold` whose record is already gone names no alias but still consumes the entry
ceiling, so an unlocked one is reclaimed as residue; otherwise that litter could
keep every scan capped. That reclaim is limited to an EMPTY holder with the
writer's own `<pid>-<uuid4 hex>` stem: the writer publishes every holder empty and
never writes to it (the lock occupies no bytes), and the name alone is no proof
that this module wrote it. A file such as an operator's `notes.hold`, or any
non-empty holder whatever its name, is left in place (and still counts against
the ceiling). A cap, an unreadable
record and an open/iteration failure diverge only in what they do with residue
already validated earlier in that same pass: a failed open or iteration of the
directory trusts nothing it observed and discards its queued residue, while a
capped or expired scan, or one that met an unreadable record (the scan notes it
and keeps walking within its cap and deadline), first reclaims the
crash/finalizer residue it lock-validated -- each unlink is identity-checked on
its own pair, and otherwise a flood of records past the ceiling or one
persistent bad record would make the state absorbing, permanently deferring
cleanup of leases already proven stale -- and only then answers uncertain. All
three are logged at INFO with the number of leases reclaimed. A held matching lease no longer
short-circuits the scan: liveness is carried by the alias union, so the scan runs
to the end, and a clean completion reclaims the crash/finalizer residue queued
earlier in the pass EVEN when held leases exist. Residue is only ever unlinked
after the directory scan closes, never mid-iteration.
Within the bound, pruning reads each record without any lock and tests its `.hold`
with a non-blocking exclusive acquisition: a held lease adds every alias it names
to the live union, while an unlocked one is crash/finalizer residue and both files
are identity-checked and reclaimed. An unreadable, malformed, linked, replaced, or
otherwise uncertain lease marks the pass uncertain, so every candidate is kept;
the scan keeps walking and still drains the residue it validated. A cap or spent
deadline, and an unreadable record, are logged at INFO with the count reclaimed. A
failed open or iteration of the directory itself trusts nothing it observed: it
discards the queued residue and answers uncertain, with no INFO line. OS
lock release makes a crashed process's lease stale without trusting a PID. The
prune performs this scan once and tests a single alias by membership in the
returned live set; there is no separate single-alias predicate.

Alias publication and pruning share one cross-process lock sidecar in the native
agents directory, with a two-second acquisition ceiling instead of the platform
lock's general five-minute ceiling. A sidecar that is a symlink or junction,
changes identity while opened or acquired, or is otherwise unverifiable is
treated as lock failure. Removal revalidates the candidate's identity, bytes and
digest-bound ownership sidecar under that lock immediately before
unlinking it. POSIX uses descriptor-relative identity-checked deletion; Windows
uses the same global publisher lock plus a final no-link identity check before
its by-name unlink. An unknown platform without either contract retains the
unused alias. A changed, unreadable, oversized, or otherwise uncertain candidate
remains on disk. If the lock cannot be opened or acquired, preparation retains
every alias and the current settings file byte-for-byte, then falls back to the
authored native agent rather than risking a stale-snapshot overwrite or blocking
startup. Active, foreign-home, unmarked, malformed, unreadable, oversized or
otherwise uncertain alias files remain on disk.

`kirocrew doctor`'s Agents Directory section reports the census read-only,
through `census_projected_aliases` in this module, reached over the
`agent_sdk.drivers.acp` seam like the doctor's other backend reads, so the
record shapes stay here; the lease record itself is parsed by the one
`_read_lease_record` the liveness probe also uses, and the data-home identity
the `foreign_home` split is judged against is resolved inside the census with
the publisher's own spelling, so no caller can hand it a differently normalised
id. It counts how many `kirocrew-skill-view-*.json` aliases the directory
holds, how many a lease record names, how many -- among the named and the
unnamed separately -- an ownership sidecar attributes to another Kiro Crew data
home (two homes share this directory whenever they share `~/.kiro`), and how
many lease records are unreadable; a record nested past the interpreter limit
reads as unreadable rather than aborting, for the probe and the census alike.
What the census retains is bounded (`_CENSUS_MAX_ALIASES`, the diagnostic's
own memory budget) and its lease walk has no separate ceiling: it charges every
directory entry, records and `.hold` sidecars alike, against the reclaim scan's
own `_PROJECTION_LEASE_SCAN_LIMIT`, so one constant decides where the census
stops and where every prune defers. A hit bound is reported as `truncated`: the measured counts are then floors, the
derived ones (not-named, this home's share) are not printed. An unscanned
record could be the unreadable one that makes a reclaim pass fail closed, so
the report says reclaimability is unknown rather than promising a drain. A
backlog left by a build that predates the reclaim is thereby visible without
`ls`, and its drain can be watched. Above
`_SKILL_VIEW_BACKLOG_WARN` (2,000, the same number the projection enforces as
`SKILL_VIEW_PROJECTION_CEILING`, so a host the doctor warns about is a host whose
next spawn has already fallen back to its authored agent; a healthy host carries
roughly authored agents x workspaces) it warns and says exactly which share the
reclaim covers: this home's unreferenced aliases, a bounded number per spawn;
this home's lease-named aliases are described as kept while their lease is
held (the census probes no lock, so a crash-stale record is indistinguishable
from a held one and is reclaimed on the next spawn's probe); aliases another
data home owns, leased or not, never drain here; and while a lease record is
unreadable nothing is reclaimed, which the report states instead of promising a
drain. The manual fallback -- moving the aliases and their metadata directory
out with the gateway stopped, or with every gateway that uses the directory
stopped once another home's aliases are present -- is named without being
performed and without suggesting a delete: the doctor
cannot prove who authored a file that merely carries the prefix, and a move is
undoable.

Windows runtime teardown records the reaped return code after the owned-handle
drain, before dropping the process reference, just as POSIX teardown does. The
existing death summary is amended without changing its reason or stderr tail.

## Backend Selection

`AcpSessionHandle.active_agent` records the mode named by session configuration,
a completed mode handshake or an observed agent-switch event. A queued mode
request clears that observation until confirmation. `AcpSessionProvider` exposes
`loaded_capability_template` only for a live dedicated Kiro runtime whose active
mode matches its launch template; shared handles provide no full-spec loading
claim. Member generation and MCP-readiness checks belong to
[session](session.md#member-capability-generations).

The `member_context` flag captures native instruction sources so essential
context delivery can deduplicate them; it does not change sandboxing or MCP
transport. Member calls use the ordinary authenticated session identity and the
gateway's canonical execution record. No member-specific ancestry proof or
filesystem-isolation capability is required.

The shared Kiro runtime carries its ordinary signed session token on eligible
unpooled `kirocrew-core` and `kirocrew-cron` stdio elements, on both `session/new`
and `session/load`. An empty broker stub list does not remove this identity
channel. Only existing, referenced managed declarations are projected; an
existing broker element wins. Disabled servers, native-only restrictions,
custom commands and registry-governed entries remain with Kiro's native loader
rather than losing their restrictions in the ACP array. A native entry without
another verifiable identity channel retains the strict caller refusal.

`memory_mode` is fixed before provider startup and before `session/new`, including
late-start adoption. Incognito and Temporary suppress Crew raw-frame recording
and payload diagnostics, do not resume retained native context, and cannot retain
native transcripts for continuation. Shared-runtime recording latches off before
a restricted session can emit its first frame. Normal shutdown and abandoned
late starts clean the native transcript files supported by the provider. This
does not add a sandbox or promise control over every external provider's own
on-disk session format or crash recovery.

`AcpClient(acp_backend=...)` stores the id without validating it; the id is
validated at config load (`_normalize_acp_backend`, harness-parity H3), and an
unknown id fails later at the harness or launch lookup. The launch record comes
from `agent_sdk/backends.py`. Current ids are `""`
(kiro-cli), `"kas"`, `"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"opencode"`, `"pi"`, `"goose"`,
and `"deepseek"`; public-build selectability is a separate registry. The complete
launch and host-capability table is in
[agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md#column-meaning). Two launch paths
need additional detail here:

- `""` (default): `kiro-cli acp --agent <name>` (resolved by `_resolve_kiro_bin`). Per-session kiro settings are layered in via the workspace overlay `<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json` (written by `AcpProvider`, not the client): reasoning **effort** (`chat.modelDefaults`) and **MCP Tool Search** (`toolSearch.enabled` + activation thresholds from `agent.tool_search_min_pct` / `tool_search_min_tokens`, gated by `agent.tool_search`, default on) — see providers.md.
- `"claude"` (`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`): `claude-agent-acp` (resolved by `_resolve_claude_acp_bin` → `(list[str] | None, str)` (argv plus the augmented PATH actually searched)). Resolution order: `CLAUDE_AGENT_ACP_BIN` env var, then a **project-local copy** (`_resolve_vendored_claude_acp` — `<node_modules>/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js` found under the roots `_vendored_acp_roots` returns: the package's optional `_vendor/node_modules` copy and `$KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR/node_modules`; needs no global npm install or network), then `mise which claude-agent-acp` (respects MISE_DATA_DIR and all mise config), then a direct glob under mise's Node installs dir (`_mise_node_installs_dir` — `<mise-data>/installs/node`, root from `env.mise_data_dir` so MISE_DATA_DIR / XDG_DATA_HOME are honoured), then augmented PATH (`env.augmented_path` — mise shims, `~/.npm-packages/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, plus EVERY per-version manager bin dir via `env.node_all_bin_dirs` (mise/asdf/nvm/fnm, all installed versions — a global npm binary can live under any of them), so a non-login launchd/systemd gateway also finds globally-installed binaries). Nothing vendors the adapter into a build; `install.sh` provisions it with `npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`. `_resolve_vendored_claude_acp` is the claude spelling of the ONE project-local check shared by the three Node adapter resolvers (`_vendored_adapter_entry`; codex-acp and pi-acp call it with their own entry and marker): a copy is accepted only when the adapter's dependency marker `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` is reachable the way Node resolves a bare import from the entry script's **real path** (`os.path.realpath`, then `node_modules` directories walked upward from there -- `_node_module_search_dirs`). An ordinary `npm install` satisfies that at the hoisted root; a `file:` / `npm link` install is a symlink whose dependencies sit under the link target's own `node_modules`, which an earlier root-only check never looked at, so every linked adapter was rejected as incomplete and the ladder fell through -- silently -- to the global copy on PATH (#13869). An entry whose dependency is reachable nowhere is still skipped in favour of the next candidate instead of being spawned and crashed, and the skip is logged once with the entry, the dependency and the real location, so the fall-through is never silent. For scripts under mise installs, returns `[node_binary, script_path]` to bypass `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang resolution which fails in non-interactive daemon contexts. For standalone binaries, returns `[binary_path]`. Pre-spawn the client writes `<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json` with `defaultMode: default` so the adapter routes every tool decision back to Kiro Crew via `session/request_permission`. This makes claude-agent-acp participate in the same approve / trust_reads / trust / yolo protocol as kiro-cli — dashboard, subagents, channel agents, cron, and heartbeat all share the path. Kiro Crew still enforces per-tool security via `HooksConfig.auto_deny_tools` (evaluated by `HookManager.on_tool_call` in `hooks.py`) on every `session/request_permission` event. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (an isolated config root, distinct from the project-scope `<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json` the client writes itself) is **not** set by this core: `_spawn` merges a caller's `extra_env` into the child environment, so an edition can point the adapter's `SettingsManager` and the SDK at a seeded root, but with nothing supplied they read the user's global `~/.claude` — which is a live gate-bypass hazard for inherited `permissions.allow` entries, recorded as a known gap in claude-code-provider.md. The env also carries `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` (claude backend only, set in `_spawn` when unset): the adapter delegates the model turn to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, which needs a per-platform native Claude binary (~250 MB each) shipped as npm `optionalDependencies` that the website install omits — so the vendored closure does **not** include it and the SDK fails `session/new` with `Claude native binary not found for <platform>`. The SDK does **not** search PATH for `claude` itself (so the host merely having the external agent CLI installed is not enough), and bundling a quarter-GB binary per platform is not viable; instead `_resolve_claude_code_executable` finds an existing `claude` (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` override → `mise which claude` → augmented PATH incl. `~/.toolbox/bin`, where a managed distribution may ship the external agent CLI) and the adapter forwards it to the SDK as `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` (no version check). If none is found the var is left unset (with a warning) so the adapter's native-binary error surfaces rather than a guessed bad path; an explicit operator-set value always wins.

When the Claude adapter is not found, the spawn error reports the augmented PATH
captured by that resolution attempt. The failed result and its PATH are cached
together so a later environment change cannot make the diagnostic claim it
searched elsewhere.

**Kiro executable resolution at spawn.** Trust is "the CLI runs": any resolvable
executable Kiro CLI launches for ACP, regardless of install source, owner, or
fixed path — Kiro Crew is not the authority on where Kiro CLI is installed, and
Kiro CLI's own self-updater legitimately rewrites its bytes as the user, so an
install-source/owner/path/codesign gate would strand real installs (toolbox,
Homebrew, winget, a self-updated `/Applications` bundle) with no recovery path.
On Windows the fixed candidates include the native per-user install at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kiro-Cli` before the machine-wide `Program Files\Kiro-Cli`
location. After the inherited `PATH`, discovery also checks the shared set of
standard user tool directories, preserving managed installations without
hardcoding package-manager-specific paths. Discovery therefore sees a CLI
installed after the desktop gateway started even though that process retains
its old `PATH`. When resolution fails, the spawn error names this same bounded
set of searched directories rather than claiming only the inherited `PATH` was
searched.
`snapshot_trusted_acp_executable` refuses only a non-runnable candidate and
returns the resolved path; `TrustedAcpExecutableSnapshot` carries only
`launch_path`.

**The CLI is always launched IN PLACE — never from a copy.** Kiro Crew execs the
binary at the path it resolved, on every platform. This is a hard requirement,
not a preference:

- **Kiro CLI 2.15+ is a multi-call binary.** It dispatches subcommands by
  exec'ing a SIBLING executable (e.g. `kiro-cli-chat`) that it locates relative
  to its own executable path — on macOS by finding `.app/Contents/MacOS/` in that
  path. Copying the binary into a flat private directory strands the sibling, so
  every dispatch fails with `No such file or directory (os error 2)` and ACP dies
  at the handshake with `process exited (rc=None)`.
- The same breaks any launcher that resolves adjacent resources: a multiplexer
  dispatching on `argv[0]` (`~/.toolbox/bin/kiro-cli` → `toolbox-exec`), a
  wrapper reading a sibling registry, or a self-updating install whose real
  payload lives beside it. The launch path is therefore the path the caller
  resolved, **not** its realpath. One exception, a pod child only: its remapped
  `$HOME` puts the sibling nowhere, so `apply_pod_bundle_spawn` resolves a
  symlinked `argv[0]` **onto a verified `<name>.app/Contents/MacOS/` target only** —
  same basename, executable, with a `<basename>-` sibling beside it. Verifying the
  whole layout, not just that the link resolves, is what keeps the exception off
  the `argv[0]`-dispatching multiplexer above and off any wrapper that finds its
  resources through the path it was invoked by. Crew's launcher still takes the
  sandbox, though not for the bundle swap's reason: no shim is in this chain, and
  delegating would skip Crew's seatbelt for an internal sandbox whose behaviour
  under the pod's remapped `$HOME` Crew cannot verify.

No copy-then-exec strategy (a sealed memfd, a verified private copy) is used for
the Kiro CLI. The threat such a copy would close is an attacker who already has
write access to the user's own machine, which the rest of the product does not
defend against either, and its cost is breaking every multi-call and multiplexer
install outright. The
spawn still passes an explicit `is_kiro_cli` classification to `wrap_argv`, so
macOS internal-sandbox delegation never depended on a private launch-path
basename, and Windows can grant its Kiro-only delegation without trusting a
filename heuristic. Resolution runs off the event loop (`asyncio.to_thread`, shielded so a
cancelled caller still lets the worker settle).

## Tool Permission Protocol

`session/request_permission` is the single inbound channel. The agent sends:

```jsonc
{ "method": "session/request_permission",
  "params": { "sessionId": "...", "options": [PermissionOption], "toolCall": ToolCallUpdate } }
```

**Unknown server→client requests are answered, never dropped.** `session/request_permission` is the only inbound *request* `AcpClient` implements. `AcpSessionHandle` serves three more, all KAS-specific: `_kiro/hooks/list`, `_kiro/hooks/sessionStart` and `_kiro/hooks/executeHook`, answered from `acp/kas_wire.py` (see agent-host-contract.md, which states the four gates `executeHook` passes before anything spawns). `_kiro/hooks/executeHook` is routed there only while hooks are announced in the handshake (`kas_wire.hooks_announced()`); `KAS_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` announces none today, so it is answered `-32601`. They are matched in that handle's own dispatch loop, ahead of the shared classifier, precisely so the classifier keeps reporting them as unknown on the `AcpClient` path — which serves no hooks surface, and where naming an action no branch handles would leave the request unanswered instead of refused. Any other server→client request (method **and** id — e.g. `fs/read_text_file`, `terminal/create`) is classified by `_process_message` as `"server_request_unknown"`. Every prompt dispatch site (`send_message_stream`, `_dispatch_events`, `_read_prompt_response`) handles that action by calling `_reject_unknown_server_request`, which replies with a JSON-RPC `-32601` (`JSONRPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, "Method not found") error via `_send_error`. Without this, JSON-RPC semantics leave the agent blocked forever on an unanswered request — the turn hangs. Notifications (method, no id) are unaffected and still classified `"skip"`.

`PermissionOption` field names differ between backends — kiro-cli uses `id`/`label`, claude-agent-acp uses `optionId`/`name` (per the public ACP spec). `_build_permission_event` reads both and remembers the optionIds keyed by `kind` (`allow_once`/`allow_always`/`reject_once`/`reject_always`) on the request id — recording an entry when **either** an allow option (for `approve_tool`) **or** a reject option (for a clean `reject_tool`) was advertised. `approve_tool(request_id, *, always=False)` echoes the matching allow id back, so the host doesn't need to know whether it's talking to kiro (`"allow_once"`/`"allow_always"`) or claude-agent-acp (`"allow"`/`"allow_always"`). `reject_tool` prefers a **clean reject**: if a reject optionId was advertised it sends `outcome: "selected"` with that id. Both backends advertise one — claude-agent-acp as `{kind:"reject_once", optionId:"reject"}` (→ `behavior:"deny"`), kiro-cli as `{kind:"reject_once", optionId:"reject_once"}` — and the fallback to `outcome: "cancelled"` therefore only applies to a backend that advertises no reject option at all. The distinction is load-bearing, not cosmetic: a clean reject resolves the tool call to `status:"failed"` with kiro-cli's fixed content `"User denied tool execution"` and the turn continues to the next model-inference boundary (`stopReason: "end_turn"`), whereas `cancelled` ends the turn immediately with `stopReason: "refusal"` and no text — and drops any queued `_session/steer` as `AgentExecutionUserMessageCleared`. That is why the host's in-band deny notice (`_steer_policy_notice`) can only be folded in on the clean-reject path, and why `stopReason: "refusal"` is NOT by itself evidence of a model-side content refusal.

Both the shared runtime and the legacy direct `AcpClient` route permission
frames through `_dispatch.build_permission_event`, including the same provenance
flags. The builder accepts string, integer, and float request ids, with booleans
excluded. A float id (`5.0`) stays a float in the pending-request maps and is
echoed unchanged by either an approval or rejection. A boolean, list, dict, or
null id produces no event. A non-null invalid id is answered exactly once with
JSON-RPC `-32600` (`"invalid request id"`) and touches no pending-request map; a
null id remains a notification and is skipped without a reply or audit row.
String-valued `toolCall` fields (`title`, `kind`, and `toolCallId`) normalize a non-string value
to an empty string before redaction, cache lookup, or event construction. A
shell-cache hit whose value is `False` sets `shell_classified=True` — it is a
resolved non-shell call, not a cache miss — and a structured-params cache hit
sets `raw_params_trusted=True`.

Both transports use `_dispatch.select_tool_title`; the direct client imports
it as `_select_tool_title`. A confirmed shell call prefers `rawInput.description`,
then its command, then the SDK title. A sub-agent call identified by a non-blank
string `rawInput.subagent_type` also prefers its description (for example Claude's
`Task` tool). Every other non-shell or unclassified call keeps the SDK title; its
`description` can be a functional argument such as an issue body and is not a
label. Refinements use cached parameters and `is_shell` when fields are absent,
including an explicit cached `False`. This display rule does not alter tool
identity, permission checks, reserved purpose arguments, or the delivered tool input.

The shell cache is written **only** from a usable backend `kind` string. A
`tool_call` frame that omits `kind` writes nothing — even when its
`_meta.kiro.mcpServerName` proves the call MCP-served — because a cached `False`
reads back as a RESOLVED non-shell classification (`shell_classified=True`),
which flips `AcpEvent.child_low_fidelity` to `False` and would un-gate the
content-matching auto-approve paths (title-keyed `auto_approve_tools`) for a
call whose title is agent-authored and whose mutating/read nature nothing
verified. The transport signal instead feeds the identity-only lane: the
`_meta.kiro` identity caches (below) carry it to the permission event, where
`AcpEvent.child_mcp_identity_trusted` and the CLI consumer's
`_unverifiable_shell` escape consume it without ever minting a classification.
The same identity is what an identity-keyed grant matches for such a child —
the hook gate's `auto_approve_tools` pattern (matched against
`@server/tool` rendered from the identity, never the title, for an
MCP-identified call) and app-own-server grant, reported as
`ToolHookResult.identity_grant`, and the TrustDropdown's `approval_command`
key — so the user's narrow allowance covers the child's call to that tool
without a session-wide trust grant (`security.md` § Child-fidelity split).
A miss keeps reading as an absent classification. Classification reads the
whole frame through `_dispatch.classify_tool_call`, not the `kind` alone: a
kiro-cli frame reporting `kind: "execute"` caches `True` whatever its
`_meta.kiro` says — that identity never waives a shell check — while a
codex-acp frame carrying the adapter-authored `_meta.is_mcp_tool_call` marker
is an MCP call the adapter happened to build with its shell builder, so it
caches `False` and takes its trusted identity from the adapter-resolved
`rawInput.server`/`rawInput.tool` pair. A marker with an unreadable pair
resolves nothing (the shell cache stays unwritten), so the permission event
stays low-fidelity rather than earning a minted non-shell verdict.

One exception fills a shell-cache MISS from the permission request itself, and
only on KAS (`build_permission_event(kas_consent_meta=True)`, set by both
transports when the backend is KAS). A KAS sub-agent spawn's `tool_call` frame
(`_meta.kiro.kind: "agent-subtask"`) is taken by
`AcpSessionHandle._handle_kas_subagent` for the sub-agent roster and never
reaches the shared parser, and its toolCallId is synthetic
(`invoke_subagent_<id>`), so every cache misses and the request would reach
`_unverifiable_shell` unclassified and be refused. The request carries the
engine-written `_meta.kiro` block, and `_dispatch.kas_consent_tool` reads it:
when the toolId is `invoke_sub_agent`, `consent.capability` is `subagent`,
`consent.resource` names the target agent and no `command` field is present,
the miss resolves to a non-shell verdict (`shell_classified=True`,
`is_shell=False`), `tool_name` is set to the Crew name `use_subagent`, and
`spawn_target` carries the target. The deny floor, `auto_deny_tools` and the
`tools` ceiling are then asked about `use_subagent` rather than the title
alone, and `HookManager.on_tool_call` judges `spawn_target` against
`capabilities.spawn` (the gate on, the target in its `agents` scope: the two
questions `subagent._vet_spawn_governance` asks on Crew's own spawn path)
inside `_governance_denial`, on the same ceiling and profile it resolved for
the `tools` question, before any grant or prompt. That profile is resolved for
the calling agent, so a profile bound to the spawning agent's name applies, and
an evaluation error refuses the spawn. Because an auto-approved spawn raises no request at all,
the shared `governance.may_skip_gate` withholds `use_subagent` from every
`allowedTools` writer, and so from the `subagent` rule on the wire and on disk,
while the ceiling or any configured profile restricts `capabilities.spawn`
(governance.md § `allowedTools`). Any other
shape stays unclassified. It never sets `is_shell` True, never overrides a
cache hit, and grants no provenance: `raw_params_trusted` and
`mcp_identity_trusted` stay `False`, so a child spawn stays
`child_low_fidelity` and title-keyed auto-approve stays gated for it exactly
as for any other child request with no trusted params.

For a CHILD event, the identity lane only helps a consumer the handle actually
delivers to: the session handle fail-closes every low-fidelity child permission
request whose consumer never set `child_fidelity_aware`
(`child_low_fidelity_unaware_consumer`). The dashboard runner and `kirocrew
chat` both opt in — the CLI qualifies because its approval path runs no
content-matching auto-approve: hook gate, then the `_unverifiable_shell`
fail-close, then an interactive prompt that shows only non-model-authored
context (the cached command, the `_meta.kiro` identity, the target path). The
opt-in admits every low-fidelity child event, not just MCP-served ones, so the
CLI's own first check re-applies the boundary: a low-fidelity child event is
rejected (`child_unverified_context`) unless its identity is verified, consumed
as `not child_unconditional_grant_eligible` — the same hoisted expression the
other grant-path consumers use, never a re-spelling — the
trusted transport identity is the one context that survives an empty params
cache and can be shown to the human, while a child edit with no cached
parameters would prompt without a Path line, an undisclosed write.

The raw-params cache is read without consuming it, so a repeated permission frame
for the same `toolCallId` keeps the original tool-call arguments authoritative
instead of falling back to the permission frame's agent-authored inline input. A
genuine miss may carry inline data for display, but both provenance flags remain
false and consumers that need trusted arguments fail closed.

The host always sends one-shot approvals (`always=False`, the default). Kiro Crew — not the agent — owns the trust scope (`slot._trust`, `slot._trust_reads`, `slot._trusted_patterns`, `safety_override`, `channel.trusted`, parent session `approval_policy`). Per-call `session/request_permission` is required so Kiro Crew's PreToolUse hooks (`auto_deny_tools`, sensitive-path checks, credential redaction) fire on every tool invocation. The `always=True` path is reserved for a future "skip Kiro Crew hooks for this exact tool" feature; no caller passes it today.

### Approval floor in `approve_tool` (`permission_floor.py`)

Both transports' `approve_tool` methods (`AcpClient`, `AcpSessionHandle`) run the
tool gate's security tiers before sending an `allow`: `_build_permission_event`
records each event by request id in `_permission_gate_events`, and `approve_tool`
pops it and calls `permission_floor.refusal_for(event)` off the loop. A SECURITY
deny (the denied-command floor, the sensitive-path read and write checks, the
unverifiable-shell refusal) or an id with no recorded event is answered with
`reject_tool` and a `rejected_transport_floor` SEL row; a gate that cannot be
built or consulted refuses (fail closed). Refusal reasons keep their original text
for the in-band result, while operator logs and SEL metadata use the shared
fail-closed redaction helper. Both methods return `True` only after they send an
allow answer and `False` when this floor sends a rejection instead.
Every production caller consumes that result before it records approved state or
activity. This transport consultation is uncounted and writes no
`governance_decision` row (`hooks.uncounted_gate`) because the consumer's
identity-bearing consultation owns the gate decision and its audit.
Governance (identity-scoped policy) stays with the caller identity: approval
consumers call `HookManager.on_tool_call` or `refusal_for(event,
session_key=..., agent=..., security_only=False)` before their approval tiers.
This includes `stream_and_collect` under `AUTO_APPROVE`, the `AcpClient` internal
auto-approve path, the evaluation runner, and the code-review pool. When an
automatic helper resolves a request, it calls the shared identity-aware
`refusal_for` body off the event loop. Provider adapters only forward an approval
from a consumer that has completed that consultation.

The rendered tool-input cache is consumed by the first permission event, but
structured raw params remain keyed by `toolCallId` for the whole turn. A repeated
permission for the same call therefore retains the fact that a non-shell MCP tool
had arguments; it cannot be reclassified as an inputless canonical tool and match
session durable trust merely because the display cache was already consumed.

A remote (HTTP) MCP server's initial `tool_call` legitimately streams an empty or
absent `rawInput`, so the params cache stays empty and every child permission
request for such a tool is low-fidelity (`AcpEvent.child_low_fidelity`) on the
arguments half. The `_meta.kiro` identity caches are written unconditionally from
the same frame, so the permission event still carries the verified
`mcp_server_name`/`tool_name` pair plus the explicit `mcp_identity_trusted`
provenance flag (set only when BOTH cache reads hit — mirroring
`raw_params_trusted`, so an inline fallback can never count as verified);
`AcpEvent.child_mcp_identity_trusted` exposes
that verified-identity half (arguments unverified) and
`AcpEvent.child_unconditional_grant_eligible` hoists the grant-eligibility
expression for the unconditional grant paths documented in
`security.md` § Child-fidelity split.

The handshake also branches on the backend:

- `protocolVersion` in the `initialize` request: kiro-cli expects the date string `"2025-08-22"`; claude-agent-acp expects an integer (`1`, per the upstream ACP SDK schema).
- claude skips `session/set_mode` and uses `session/set_config_option` (configId `model`) instead of `session/set_model`.

Sending the wrong shape yields `-32602 Invalid params` or `-32601 Method not found`.

**`clientCapabilities` in the `initialize` request.** Both transports (`AcpClient._initialize_session` and `AcpRuntime`) send the shared `ACP_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` dict from `acp/types.py`. Without the key the agent would assume the all-false default.

**`agentInfo.version` from the `initialize` response.** Both transports retain it (`AcpClient.agent_version`, `AcpRuntime.agent_version`, surfaced through `AcpSessionHandle` → `AcpSessionProvider` → `AcpProvider.agent_version`; `""` until the handshake completes). It is the version the spawned process RUNS, which after an in-place kiro-cli upgrade differs from the binary on disk — the MCP hot-reload gate reads it for that reason. Parsed with the shared `agent_version_from_init` in `acp/_dispatch.py`; a missing or non-string value reads as unknown rather than failing the handshake.

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `fs.readTextFile` / `fs.writeTextFile` | `false` | We serve no `fs/*` handler; advertising them would invite requests that hit `_reject_unknown_server_request`. |
| `terminal` | `false` | Same — the agent uses its own tools. |
| `elicitation` | *(absent)* | **Withdrawn forward-bet.** It was declared while kiro-cli 2.14.0 compiled the `elicitation/create` schema but did not yet route an MCP server's request out over ACP, on the reasoning that declaring it cost nothing until a handler existed. It costs something. A client that sees the capability sends its human-in-the-loop prompts as `elicitation/create` **instead of** falling back to `session/request_permission` — codex-acp gates on `clientCapabilities.elicitation.form` exactly that way — so the declaration does not wait inertly for a handler, it diverts a working path onto one that answers `-32601`, which that client turns into a cancellation of the tool call the human was approving. Absent, every affected client returns to the fallback that works. Re-add the key **in the same change** that registers the handler: `test_elicitation_is_not_advertised_without_a_handler` fails the moment it reappears. Handler work is tracked in #891. |

**Request-id namespaces are independent.** Our outbound requests (prompt, initialize, set_model, ...) use `_next_req_id()`; the agent's inbound server→client requests (`session/request_permission`) carry their own id counter. The two collide on small integers, so `JsonRpcMessage.is_response_for(req_id)` requires both `id == req_id` **and** `method is None` — a response never has a `method`. Without the `method is None` guard, a permission request whose id equals the in-flight prompt's `req_id` was misclassified as that prompt's completion in `_process_message`, ending the turn early and leaving the tool's permission unanswered → the agent turn hangs on follow-up messages (the agent waits forever for a `session/request_permission` response that never comes).

This same method-aware discipline is enforced in `_wait_for_response()`. While it awaits a specific `req_id`, an inbound server→client **request** (method + id — e.g. a colliding `session/request_permission`) or a **foreign-id response** (id ≠ req_id, no method) must not be misread as the awaited response, must not be dropped, and must not be re-appended to `self._buffer` and `continue`-d. The last is the critical hazard: `_read_message()` pops `self._buffer` first, so re-buffering + looping immediately re-reads the same frame and **spins until the deadline** (the original bug — stuck `init`/`load`/`set_config_option` ending in `AcpTimeoutError`). Instead, non-matching survivable frames are collected into a **local `deferred` list** and re-injected at the **front** of `self._buffer` *in arrival order* once the matching response arrives (or on timeout/shutdown), so a later `_prompt_loop`/`_process_message` can still answer a deferred permission request. Notifications (method, no id) continue to go to `_mcp_notifications` for `_drain_notifications`.

## Agent Configuration

Data-driven — no code changes needed:
- `config/defaults.json` — base config (tools, model, permissions), resolved via `_BUNDLED_CFG_DIR` in `agent.py`
- `config/prompt.md` — system prompt, resolved via `_BUNDLED_CFG_DIR` in `agent.py`
- `~/.kiro/crew/agent.json` — user overrides (optional)
- Run `kirocrew setup --agent-only` after editing

There is no checked-in `agents/` directory. `agent.py` reads
`<KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR>/agents/defaults.json` and `prompt.md` only when that variable
points at a project holding them; otherwise it uses the bundled `src/kiro_crew/config/`.

The shipped prompt is a self-contained input; custom/app agents can supply
their own prompts. Its compact tool directory retain exact callable syntax, session ownership,
privacy boundaries, stop conditions and output formats. Shared wording is not
moved into a common include: source deduplication alone would not reduce the
selected prompt sent to the model. `test/test_prompt_compact_contract.py` checks
each file's UTF-8 size budget, template slots and critical operational clauses. The size budget is an
absolute UTF-8 byte ceiling per selectable prompt: a context-cost guard, not a
token count and not a permanent ban on new rules. A maintainer may raise a
ceiling in a reviewed change when a rule earns its bytes; the clause tests, not
the ceiling, decide whether a contract survived. Prompt tests guard text
contracts, not a guarantee that a model follows them; runtime controls remain
authoritative. The normal prompt's browser instructions keep approval groups,
borrowed-browser ownership and subagent session isolation inline rather than
relying on a skill pointer for those controls.

Default model: `auto`. Default tools: `execute_bash`, `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `code`, `grep`, `glob`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `introspect`, `session`, `report`, `tool_search`, `@kirocrew-cron`, `@kirocrew-core`, `@kirocrew-computer`.

**Agent compatibility repair** (`agent.py`): `repair_agent_configs()` is the single
entry point. It runs as the last step of every `rebuild_agent_config()`, which is
event-driven (setup and install, a provider or model change, the MCP and connection
handlers, a governance ceiling refresh); there is no timer. Its
`_sanitize_agent_hooks()` pass repairs only the exact host-managed filenames in
`agent_files.OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`. Kiro-cli rejects the legacy
`auto_approve_tools` variant in an agent spec's `hooks` field, causing silent
fallback to the default agent which loses the internal MCP servers. The repair
therefore removes that one Kiro Crew-authored legacy key and preserves every
unknown key; an unfamiliar key may belong to a newer kiro-cli schema or to the
user. Foreign specs, prefix lookalikes such as `kirocrew-custom.json`, and app
materialized specs are never scanned or rewritten. Mtime-based caching skips
unchanged owned files. Bundled `auto_approve_tools` patterns are applied at
runtime in the hooks layer (`_BUNDLED_AUTO_APPROVE_TOOLS` in `hooks.py`) rather
than being serialized to the config file. `_kiro_hooks_only()` remains the
strict filter for newly generated Kiro Crew specs, where Kiro Crew owns the whole
output schema.

## Custom Agent Support

Custom-agent support is backend-specific. Kiro CLI consumes the selected agent
through `--agent`; KAS projects it on the wire; foreign hosts translate, withhold,
or decline fields through their provider-mirror contracts. The authoritative
per-backend matrix is [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md#1-agent-definition-and-layout).
The details below describe the Kiro and Claude paths implemented directly here:

- **Model (kiro-cli)**: `set_model` is skipped for custom agents — kiro-cli uses the
  agent's own `model` field. Only the default kirocrew agent gets Kiro Crew's
  configured model override.
- **MCP servers**: backend-dependent.
  - **kiro-cli**: kiro-cli loads ordinary servers from the agent config. The
    shared runtime adds eligible managed control-plane elements carrying the
    per-session token, plus configured broker stubs, to `mcpServers`; it does not
    project third-party declarations. Override eligibility reads project and
    global MCP settings through the bounded sensitive-path reader. A refused,
    unreadable or malformed settings file withholds these overrides, preserving
    native restrictions; only an absent settings file, or one that is empty or
    holds only JSON whitespace (space, tab, CR, LF), with or without a single
    leading UTF-8 byte-order mark, contributes no restrictions. A document behind
    that same BOM is parsed normally. Off the event loop a read may pause for a
    retry, so `session_mcp.native_settings_sources` brackets each pass with every
    file's identity and keeps a pass only when no file was replaced or rewritten
    while it ran; after `_NATIVE_SOURCES_BRACKETED_PASSES` (4) voided passes the
    set is treated as unreadable, the same as a refused read. When the settings
    are unreadable every identity element is withheld and a WARNING names the
    agent: its unpooled Kiro Crew servers mounted from the spec then refuse calls
    with `identity_unattested`, while pooled broker stubs keep their token.
    kiro-cli loads
    servers from the agent config (respects `mcpServers` in the agent's config
    file). Non-kirocrew agents (e.g. AIM-installed) load only their own
    `mcpServers`. The kirocrew agent loads from global `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
    where `disabled` and `disabledTools` flags are respected. Kiro Crew's dashboard
    MCP tab writes directly to the global config. Loading is not one-shot:
    kiro-cli 2.10.0+ watches the agent file and reconciles a RUNNING session
    against an edit (only the changed servers restart, conversation kept, applied
    at the next turn boundary), which is why the dashboard's MCP sync skips its
    session reset on that harness — gate and semantics in
    [mcp.md](../../architecture/mcp.md#live-reconcile-when-no-restart-is-needed-at-all).
  - **claude-agent-acp**: does NOT read any config file or `--agent` flag, so
    `session/new` (and `session/load`) must carry the servers in the
    `mcpServers` param. `_session_mcp_servers()` — gated on
    `backend in ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY` (`acp_backends.py`) rather than on
    the harness's identity, so the next adapter that reads no agent spec joins the
    set instead of adding a branch — delegates to
    `acp/session_mcp.py:session_mcp_servers`, which reads the SAME
    materialized kiro agent spec (there is no CC-shaped second registry to keep in
    sync) and reshapes it to the ACP array (stdio →
    `{name,command,args,env:[{name,value}],type:"stdio"}`; url →
    `{name,type:"http"|"sse",url,headers:[{name,value}]}` — `env`/`headers` are
    required arrays, emitted even when empty, and the transport `type` is always
    explicit). The spec's `tools` references gate what mounts, so an entry kiro-cli
    declares but does not mount stays unmounted here too; `type:"registry"`
    catalog pointers are withheld; `timeout`, `disabledTools` and `autoApprove` are
    kiro-only and dropped (`autoApprove` deliberately — its CC equivalent would
    stop the call reaching Crew's gate). kirocrew-core/cron are re-derived from
    `agent.managed_mcp_spec_entry`, overriding a stale spec entry, and are present
    even when no spec exists. Read per spawn so MCP installs/toggles apply on the
    next session without a gateway restart.
- **Tools/allowedTools/toolsSettings**: Applied by kiro-cli via `set_mode`.
- **Prompt/resources/hooks**: Applied by kiro-cli via `set_mode`.
- **Denied commands**: Enforced at Kiro Crew's `hooks.py` PreToolUse gate;
  see [security](security.md).

Kiro CLI custom agents use a cold start with `--agent <name>` at spawn time.
Other backends follow the selection and projection contracts in
[agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md#1-agent-definition-and-layout).

## Protocol Flow

`initialize` → `session/load` or `session/new` → `set_mode` (conditional) → `set_model` (conditional) → drain notifications → `session/prompt`

`ensure_ready()` creates `_work_dir` once per instance (off-loop `mkdir -p`,
remembered via a flag) so the per-prompt warm path pays no filesystem syscall;
`_spawn()` re-creates it (also off-loop) on every spawn, and `_reset_state()`
clears the process and session id together, so every session-init path re-enters
`_spawn` first. A per-prompt re-check could not repair external deletion for a
live child anyway: kiro-cli's spawned shell inherits the client's cwd by inode,
not by path, so re-creating the directory does not restore it.

Steps 1–2 (`initialize`, `session/load` or `session/new`) block until a JSON-RPC
response arrives (base 240s) because the session ID is required before proceeding.
If the first attempt times out, `ensure_ready()` kills the process and retries once
with a fresh spawn — this handles slow kiro-cli first launches where MCP servers are
still initializing.  `_wait_for_response()` checks `shutdown_event` each iteration
so init aborts promptly on Ctrl+C instead of blocking for the full timeout.

**Activity-based deadline.** `_wait_for_response()`'s deadline is *not* a fixed
wall-clock. Every received frame (notification, deferred server request, or
foreign response) resets the deadline to `now + timeout`, bounded by an absolute
`_WAIT_RESPONSE_MAX_TIMEOUT` (600s) safety cap. This matters for `session/load`:
the adapter streams the ENTIRE prior transcript as `session/update`
**notifications** before resolving the load response, so a fixed deadline would
kill a long replay and silently fall back to `session/new`. Extending only while
the agent is actively sending data is safe for the init/handshake callers — the
hard cap still bounds a truly stuck handshake.

### Session Resume via `session/load`

When `set_resume_session_id(sid)` is called before `ensure_ready()`, the client
attempts `session/load` instead of `session/new`:

1. Check `agentCapabilities.loadSession` from `initialize` response
2. Verify `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/{sid}.json` exists on disk
3. Send `session/load` with `sessionId`, `cwd`, `mcpServers` (the pooled
   broker stubs, re-declared so the resumed session keeps talking to the
   shared gateway — `session/load` re-initializes the session's MCP servers,
   so an empty list would un-pool the session), plus eligible unpooled managed
   elements carrying their session token, and
   `_meta: {"_kiro.dev/session_file": "<path>"}` (required —
   without it kiro-cli silently ignores the request). `AcpRuntime.load_session`
   builds the same params for the multiplexed runtime.
4. On success (response contains `modes`): set `_session_id`, `_resumed = True`
5. On failure (JSON-RPC error, timeout, file missing): fall through to `session/new`

The resume ID is consumed on attempt (no retry loop). After successful load,
`client.resumed` returns `True` — callers use this to skip thread history injection.

Step 3 (`set_mode`) is **conditional**: sent for all kiro-cli backend agents.
Skipped for claude-agent-acp, whose `session/set_mode` takes permission modes
(`default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, ...) rather than agent names. The claude
session that leaves a project-owned settings file out uses that verb to pin
`default` (see claude-code-provider.md).
Two of the guards in front of it, on `session/new` and `session/load` alike,
end the session rather than let it run as a different agent. Guard (A): when
the response advertises a `modes` list, the requested agent must be in it
(`AcpRuntime._mode_available`); an absent id is refused naming the spec file
and `kirocrew setup --agent-only`, never silently left on the host's default
mode. A published `<agent>--readonly` side spec is the exception: its refusal
explains the derived spec and names the base agent
(`side_readonly_spec.unavailable_mode_explanation`; see [side.md](side.md)). Guard (C): the shared runtime asks its harness
`activation_refusal(agent, resp)` (harness-parity H13: a seam, not a backend
test); the spawn-time hosts answer `None`, and the KAS harness reads the
advertised entry's `_meta.kiro.resource.source.origin`
(`_dispatch.advertised_mode_origin`). The value `bundled` -- the one stamp
MEASURED on kiro-cli 2.23.0 for the engine's own agents -- means the engine kept
its OWN built-in under that id and discarded the `customAgents` definition; a
`set_mode` would succeed and run the built-in under the crewmate's name, so the
harness answers the refusal text -- the id is reserved for a built-in agent,
plus the crewmate-side remedy in the dashboard's own labels (the Agent Template
tab; on the crewmate's own copy 'Save as new template…' under another name or
'Reset my changes'; on a shared template -- one created under a reserved id
before the refusal existed, where neither control renders -- the template
picker at the top of the tab), in plain words with no wire vocabulary or
session id, the id in curly quotes as the dialogs render it. Only that measured stamp refuses: an absent stamp (kiro-cli,
the offline fake, an older engine) is not evidence and never refuses, and a
positive stamp this code has never measured (an engine that renames `client`)
is logged at WARNING and let through, because kiro-cli is the operator's own
install, not pinned by Crew, and an unmeasured value must not become a
session-start denial of every crewmate with a rename remedy that cannot help.
The ids measured to trip (C) on kiro-cli 2.23.0 are refused before the wire by
the projection (`agent_files.KAS_RESERVED_AGENT_IDS`); (C) is the read of the
wire itself, so a built-in a later engine adds under a new id fails loudly
instead of resurrecting the silent substitution. (Guard (B) is the spawn-flag check for a markdown-only spec on a
JSON-only host, `_spawn_agent_not_loaded_reason`.)

Step 4 (`set_model`) is **conditional**: only sent when `model` is explicitly
set (i.e., for the default kirocrew agent).  Custom agents skip this so
kiro-cli uses the model from their own agent config file.

**Advertised models and read-path revalidation.** Each `AcpSessionHandle` keeps
the `availableModels` its own `session/new` answered as `available_models()`.
That answer is captured once, and a lookup racing a token refresh can return the
free tier. Two paths heal it through the runtime's `probe_advertised_models`,
which opens a throwaway minimal session (no MCP servers, no mode) on the same
process and ends it before returning: `refresh_available_models` before an
explicit `set_model` pick is refused, and `maybe_refresh_available_models(catalog_ids)`
on the model-picker read path. The read-path call probes only when the snapshot
would drop a catalog row by `catalog_row_would_drop` (the dashboard filter's own
per-row verdict, skipping the case where that filter fails open to the full
catalog) and the snapshot is suspect -- never probe-confirmed, captured within
`_READ_PATH_SPAWN_RACE_SECS` of spawn, or `auto`-only -- and a confirmed snapshot
probed within `_READ_PATH_REPROBE_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS` is trusted. The probe is one
shielded task per handle under `_READ_PATH_PROBE_DEADLINE_SECS`; a deadline miss
raises `EntitlementRevalidating` (the endpoint answers `503
model_list_revalidating`) while the task keeps running, a later read awaits the
same task, and a probe failure returns the current snapshot unchanged.

`probe_advertised_models` is single-flight with two independent clocks, both
`_ENTITLEMENT_PROBE_TTL_SECS`: a non-empty success replays on its result clock,
and an empty or failed attempt replays as `[]` (no evidence) on its attempt
clock, so a failure never revives an expired success and a burst of reads costs
one round-trip. `force=True` -- passed by an explicit `set_model` pick and the
spawn-time pin check -- skips only the attempt-clock replay, so a user action
always earns a fresh probe; the read path leaves it `False`. Either replay is
served only if its clock is at least as new as the snapshot the caller holds
(`not_before`): a cached broader answer can never replace a session's newer
narrower one, and a failed attempt that predates the snapshot never stands in
for the probe it has yet to receive. The handle dates the snapshot it stores by
the answer's own clock (`entitlement_probe_result_at`), not by its call time, so
its floor never rises above the data it holds and a replayed answer is never
re-dated out of the spawn-race window it was captured in.

**Direct-spawn revalidation.** `AcpClient` owns one process and one session, so
it has no runtime probe to borrow. It stamps its own `session/new` capture
(`_available_models_captured_at`, unconfirmed) and, before an explicit
`set_model` pick is refused or a startup pin is withheld on kiro,
`refresh_available_models` asks again: a snapshot a probe confirmed within
`_ENTITLEMENT_PROBE_TTL_SECS` is returned as is (fresh -- no round-trip); otherwise
`_probe_advertised_models` asks on a DEDICATED short-lived transport: a throwaway
`AcpClient` built by `_entitlement_probe_client` from this client's own launch
inputs (work dir, agent, env, backend, sandbox mode, gateway overlay, session key),
so `_spawn` starts it exactly as it started this session. On its own process it
sends `initialize` (the same `_initialize_params` this session's handshake sends)
and, before `session/new`, re-verifies the derived spec with
`require_unchanged_derived_spec` -- the same verify→create bracket every other
spawn path closes between initialize and session creation, so a spec revoked
during probe init aborts (raising `DerivedSpecStale`, absorbed as an empty answer)
rather than creating a session that would start that revoked spec's MCP server
commands. It then sends one minimal `session/new` (the pooled broker stubs, for
cost only), reads the answer through `advertised_models_from_session`, ends it
with the harness's teardown verb and shuts the process down, bounded by
`_INIT_TIMEOUT + _ENTITLEMENT_PROBE_TIMEOUT`. A non-empty answer replaces the
snapshot, dated by its arrival and marked confirmed; an empty or failed one is no
evidence and the refusal stands. There is no failure replay: the callers are user
actions and the picker read, the direct-client form of `force=True`.
`refresh_available_models` owns single-flight: a caller arriving while a probe is
in flight awaits that same (shielded) probe, so an overlapping picker read and
explicit pick start one probe process, never two. Because the probe never touches
this session's stream, nothing it emits -- session updates, substitution
advisories, and the MCP OAuth and init frames (keyed by `serverName`, no
`sessionId`) of whatever servers kiro-cli starts from the spec for it -- can enter
this session's notification buffer, its `_oauth_emitted_servers` dedupe or its
event stream; no frame filter, prompt hold or turn guard is needed, and isolation
does not depend on which servers the probe process happens to start.

Step 5 drains MCP server init notifications (both after `session/load` and
`session/new` — loading a session triggers MCP re-initialization).

### Notification Buffering

`AcpClient._wait_for_response()` buffers all JSON-RPC notifications in
`_mcp_notifications` instead of discarding them. `_drain_notifications()`
processes buffered notifications first, then reads any remaining from stdout.

The multiplexed `AcpRuntime` has the same guarantee for session-scoped init
frames even though it cannot register the session queue until `session/new`
or `session/load` returns the session id. While either request is in flight, the
runtime stages matching `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request`,
`_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized`, and `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_init_failure`
notifications in a bounded buffer and transfers them into the new handle's
queue once the id is known. `AcpSessionHandle.drain_init()` retains OAuth
requests for `pop_pending_oauth_requests()`; the registration frames are what
arm its idle shortcut (below). Staging is cleared when the last concurrent init
finishes, including failure paths, so a stale approval URL cannot leak into a
later session. A start whose caller already timed out keeps its own copy of the
frames on its `StartCollector` instead of in that buffer — the frames outlive the
caller's budget, and the timeout diagnostic reads the buffer un-keyed (below).

`drain_init()`'s idle shortcut means "quiet **after** the servers reported",
not "quiet, therefore done": until the first MCP registration frame
(`server_initialized` / `server_init_failure` / `oauth_request`) is observed,
queue silence is treated as a server still booting — an npx-based stdio server
spends seconds on npm resolution plus a Node boot before emitting anything —
and the drain keeps waiting, bounded by `_MCP_DRAIN_NO_REPORT_CEILING`. Once a
report has been seen it allows up to `_MCP_DRAIN_DURATION` more and exits
after `_MCP_DRAIN_IDLE_EXIT` of silence, so warm sessions (whose registration
frames were staged during `session/new`) arm immediately and pay no extra
latency. A session with no MCP servers at all is the one case that pays the
full no-report ceiling; a runtime whose agent is KNOWN to be MCP-free — the
`kirocrew-lite` background runtime, whose config Kiro Crew itself writes with
an empty `mcpServers` map — opts out via
`AcpRuntime(expect_mcp_reports=False)`, which passes a zero ceiling and keeps
the idle shortcut active from the start (the pre-ceiling behavior).

**`problem_summary()` renders the report's bad news, and nothing else.** The
report answers two different questions, so it has two renderers: `payload()` is
the whole picture a dashboard draws (including `ready` and `configured`), and
`problem_summary()` is one line naming only what this session cannot use --
`failed to start`, `awaiting authorization`, `declared by the agent spec but not
configured` -- and the EMPTY string when it can use everything. Empty-on-clean is
the contract, not a caller's convention: a consumer prints the line
unconditionally and a healthy session stays silent everywhere. It is declared on
`providers.base.SessionMcpReport` beside `payload()` because the consumers that
need it most sit outside this layer, where the agent-SDK boundary gate refuses a
new ACP import -- a sub-agent spawn reaches it through the report the provider
already hands it (`subagent_manager/run.py`).

`include_reasons=False` keeps the server names and drops the failure text. A
reason is the failing server's own startup output, so in the OAuth and
remote-contacting cases it can carry content nobody here authored, and
`sanitize_sink_text` bounds credentials, URLs, control characters and length --
none of which disarms a plain-English instruction. A log a person reads takes the
reasons; a sink that feeds a MODEL asks without them, and fences the names it does
pass.

### KAS managed MCP readiness

KAS opts into a readiness barrier through its harness notification declaration.
Its `_kiro/mcp/status` and `_kiro/tools/didChange` notifications carry an explicit
`params.sessionId` and full `servers` / `tags` snapshots. The reader stages both
methods before the create/load response and transfers only that session's frames.
Status entries carry `name`, `status`, `failedAuthorization`, `errorMessage`,
`tools` (the connected server's catalog) and `_meta.kiro.resource.source.origin`;
the required Crew declarations have origin `client`. Exposure -- the model can
reach the connected server's tools -- is established by EITHER a non-empty
`tools` catalog on the server's own `connected` entry OR a tool tag with
`source: "mcp"` and `tag: "@server/tool"`; neither is the native callable
identifier. Both are accepted because released kiro-cli versions differ: captured
2.18.0 and 2.20.0 send the catalog and the tags; captured 2.22.0 (KAS 0.66.0)
sends the full catalog on the connected entry but its `didChange` snapshots list
only `builtin` tags (`read`, `write`, `shell`, `web`), with or without
`tool_search` in the agent's tools -- no MCP tag ever arrives. The two kinds of
evidence are kept apart: a full tag snapshot replaces the tag evidence (a tag
that disappears is retracted) but never the catalog evidence, and a reconnect
(`connecting` after `connected`) clears both, so the next connected snapshot's
catalog or a later tag frame must re-establish it.

Provenance is read off the whole snapshot, not one entry. A backend that stamps
any entry stamps them all (released 2.20.0 stamps `connecting` and `connected`
alike), so on such a backend an unstamped or non-`client` required entry is a
same-named foreign server and is skipped: the private declaration may still
report, so the requirement stays pending. A backend that stamps NO entry predates
the field. Released kiro-cli 2.18.0 is one: its captured wire emits both
notifications under the session's own id with a connected catalog and tool tag,
and no `_meta` on any status entry. On that release the two declaration sites
behave differently against a same-named `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` server: an
explicit session-level `mcpServers` injection wins on `session/new` and
`session/load` alike, while the active agent's own `mcpServers` declaration is
shadowed by the global server on `session/new` and coexists with it under one
name on `session/load` — all reporting under the session's id, so the wire cannot
say which server a bare name is. The barrier therefore takes the request's own
`mcpServers` array (`injected`, intersected with the required roster) as
positive evidence: on a provenance-less snapshot an injected required server is
read as reported (connection and exposure still required; failure states still
terminal), and a required server the active agent alone declared that such a
snapshot reports as `connected` is read as `connected without provenance`, a
terminal state that ends startup with `AcpRuntimeError` naming the server and
the limit. With the carriage below, the ordinary install's managed servers are
injected and therefore start on such a release; the refusal remains only for a
managed entry the carriage leaves in the block (a `disabled`, `disabledTools`,
`timeout` or registry customization), and it is a stated compatibility limit,
not restored support: accepting the entry could hand the session a server
carrying another identity's session key and memory. Missing metadata alone
never implies `client`; the connecting state on such a backend stays pending as
usual.

After activation, create and load wait for every required managed server to be
`connected` and exposed (a connected catalog or a tool tag, as above) when
exposure is permitted.
The required roster is the union of the ACTIVE custom agent's `mcpServers`
declarations and the actual session-level injection, intersected with Crew's
managed server catalog. Inactive agents and inherited global/external servers do
not contribute requirements or satisfy them. Other-session and sessionless reports
are ignored. Reports queued
before a mode change cannot satisfy the new activation; when the prior mode is
unknown, KAS conservatively treats activation as a change. A reconnect invalidates
that server's prior tool exposure.

Before either request goes out, the runtime carries the ACTIVE agent's managed
declarations in the session-level array (`kas_agents.hoist_managed_servers`).
Captured released 2.18.0 honours that array over a same-named global or
workspace `mcp.json` server on new and load alike (the member dispatch server
already travels this way); the retained 2.20.0 capture proves a session-level
injection reports `origin: client` and reaches readiness, and its same-name
collision behaviour was not probed. The entries moved are the
already projected ones (credential fields withheld, `autoApprove` dropped,
`KIROCREW_PORT` / `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` applied), converted with
`session_mcp.acp_server_element`; no spec is re-read and the derived-spec
snapshot is unchanged. Each hoisted entry also receives this session's
`KIROCREW_STUB_SESSION_TOKEN`: the runtime stamps the token onto the
session-level array before the hoist runs, so without it the hoisted
`kirocrew-core` would be the one managed server launched unattested and refuse
every call as `identity_unattested`. Caller entries keep their own identity and
third-party servers never receive the token. A tokened entry launches the
managed invocation (`agent.managed_mcp_spec_entry(name, include_opt_in=True)`),
never the spec's `command` / `args`: KAS spawns it directly, so
`daemon/control_plane.py::_spawns_own_control_plane` never vets it, and a hand-edited spec
must not hand the token to another binary. Its env keeps only the projected
`KIROCREW_PORT` / `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` plus the managed env; a name whose
managed invocation does not resolve is hoisted as projected with no token. The move is bounded: only managed names, only the active
agent, never a name the caller's array already carries (a broker stub or the
member dispatch entry stays authoritative and a name appears once), and only a
stdio entry whose keys are drawn only from `command`, `args`, `env`, `type` — a
`disabled`, `disabledTools` or `timeout` customization, a registry marker, a
remote URL or a command-less entry keeps the agent-block path where that field
is honoured. The agent's `tools`, `excludedTools` and `permissions` are
untouched: refs resolve wherever the server was declared, and on 2.18.0 an
allowlist-only or `excludedTools` restriction on the hoisted server still
yields readiness with only the permitted tag advertised. Exact legacy
limitation: on a release that stamps no provenance, a managed entry left in the
block by one of those extra fields is still refused as
`connected without provenance`; it works on a release that stamps `origin:
client`.

For a derived worker, the projected payload carries both its checked specification
snapshot and its runtime session key through create and load. Activation checks
that same snapshot before readiness: connected tools cannot admit a revoked
template, and an unchanged template still waits for its managed tools.

The exposure check reads the active agent's projected `tools` and `excludedTools`,
plus the connected status's `tools[].disabled` flags. If these deliberately hide
every tool from a declared server, connection is sufficient: an absent tag must
not make a restricted agent unusable. An empty or missing catalog alone does not
prove that restriction. `allowedTools`/`permissions` governs approval, not
exposure; readiness never changes grants or declarations to obtain a tag.

The barrier retains the ordinary drain's config updates, pending OAuth requests,
and initialization-failure diagnostics, including for unrelated external servers.
These side effects do not satisfy or extend managed readiness. An agent with no
required managed servers keeps the ordinary drain. Readiness extends the existing
configured roster rather than resetting the report to its required subset.
Session-owned KAS status frames also update the report for external servers,
including failure, authorization and reconnect states. This display report is not
the managed-server provenance and tool-exposure gate.

The wait uses the existing `agent.session_start_timeout_secs` budget, with no
idle-success shortcut or extra sleep. `failed`, `disabled`, failed
authorization, and `connected without provenance` terminate startup with
`AcpRuntimeError`; connecting, missing
reports, or missing tool exposure remain pending until `AcpRequestTimeout`.
Errors name the required server and sanitize backend failure text. On failure,
runtime death, or cancellation, no handle escapes. A failed fresh `session/new`
is terminated through the bounded per-session teardown, freeing its resident state
and MCP children without touching siblings. A failed `session/load` is only
unregistered locally because KAS's delete verb would destroy the existing native
history; that history remains available to a later resume. No first prompt is
sent on these paths. Harnesses without this opt-in retain their existing
initialization drain.

### KAS MCP OAuth sign-in

A remote OAuth MCP server that KAS cannot reach without a token reports a `failed` status entry with `failedAuthorization: true`. Its `authorizationUrl` comes from a passive connect whose loopback callback listener is already closed, so Crew never renders it. A sign-in that can complete is started by the client: `_kiro/mcp/resetServer` with `{sessionId, serverName, startOAuth: true}` makes the engine keep its callback listener open for the whole connect attempt (the server's connect timeout, 60 s by default) and send the consent URL as a `_kiro/openExternalUrl` request. The engine sends that request only because `KAS_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` declares `_meta.kiro.openExternalUrl`.

The session handle tracks, from its own status snapshots, which servers need a sign-in: added on `failedAuthorization`, removed once the server connects, is disabled, or leaves the snapshot. A timed-out attempt reports `failedAuthorization: false` with a timeout error, so the server stays tracked. Offers rotate through the needed server names after the last accepted offer, wrapping so a repeatedly timed-out server cannot starve its peers. The tracker reads at most the report's `BUCKET_CAP` entries and skips a name over `NAME_CAP`.

A sign-in is offered only where a turn is reading the queue, because the consent URL comes back on that queue: at turn start, after the pre-turn stale drain, and mid-turn when the dispatch loop reads a status snapshot. Session start (the managed-readiness barrier and the init drain) reads status without offering: a start that fails there is torn down, and a link it started would land between turns. The pre-turn drain reads every between-turns status snapshot before dropping it, so a server that connected while no turn was reading leaves the set and the turn-start offer never resets a connected server (a reset with `startOAuth` invalidates its credentials). The pre-turn drain keeps an owned `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` frame only while the runtime holds the sign-in slot for that session and `serverName`; otherwise it drops the stale link.

`_kiro/openExternalUrl` names neither the session nor the server, so the runtime runs at most one sign-in per process (`AcpRuntime.begin_mcp_sign_in`), gated on `ACP_BACKENDS_OPEN_EXTERNAL_URL`. The slot is held until the reset is answered, even after its session unregisters, so a departed session's late link is refused rather than handed to a newer sign-in; the slot's own timeout sits past the engine's 600 s connect ceiling. The URL is put on the owning session's queue as an ordinary `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` frame and answered `{success: true}`; it therefore takes the same URL checks and the same Authorize banner as the kiro-cli engine's own request. It is refused with a JSON-RPC error when no sign-in is in flight, when the owning session is gone, or when the URL is not http(s); the engine raises on that error, so the attempt ends at once instead of waiting for a callback no user was shown. `secretStorage` is not declared, so the engine keeps the resulting grant in its own memory: Crew stores no MCP token, and a new KAS process needs a new sign-in.

KAS sends no `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized` frame when a sign-in completes; the server's next status entry reports `connected`, and status snapshots are classified `skip`. The tracker therefore records a tracked server that connects as a completed sign-in, and the dispatch loop yields one `EVENT_MCP_SERVER_INITIALIZED` (`runtime_global: false`) for each such server right after it reads a status snapshot, clearing the server's banner dedupe as the frame-driven branch does. A completion read by the session-start or pre-turn drain is yielded with the next turn's first frame. Only a server that was being tracked for a sign-in qualifies; an ordinary connected server yields nothing. The dashboard handles the event as it handles the engine's own frame: the Authorize banner is marked completed and its dead consent URL is withdrawn.

## Key APIs

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ensure_ready()` | Spawn kiro-cli + init handshake (steps 1-5) |
| `send_message(msg)` | Full response text, auto-approves tools |
| `send_message_stream(msg)` | Yields text chunks, auto-approves (CLI) |
| `stream_events(msg)` | Yields `AcpEvent` objects, caller handles permissions (dashboard) |
| `approve_tool(id)` / `reject_tool(id)` | Tool permission responses |
| `send_command(cmd)` | Slash commands (e.g. `/compact`), returns response text |
| `command_result(cmd)` | Kiro-only native command result including structured `data`; internal callers must reduce it before external use |
| `cancel_session()` | Cancel in-flight operation |
| `wait_turn_done(timeout)` | Wait for the current prompt to finish; returns `stop_reason` or raises `asyncio.TimeoutError` |
| `has_active_turn()` | Returns `True` while a prompt is in flight and not yet complete |
| `shutdown()` | Kill kiro-cli process |

The Connections authenticated Test action is the only application consumer of
`command_result`. Its agent-SDK driver resolves the operator's configured
`agent.sandbox` tier off the event loop, gives readiness plus the ordered command
batch one total timeout, and calls `shutdown()` in a `finally` on success, failure,
timeout, or caller cancellation. Only the bounded verdict and tool count leave
the Connections layer; raw command data and tool descriptions do not reach the
HTTP response.

### Extension Notifications

`stream_events()` yields events for kiro-cli extension notifications:

| Notification | Event Kind | Fields |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` | `compaction_status` | `text` = started/completed/failed, `title` = summary |
| `_kiro.dev/clear/status` | `clear_status` | (none); also invalidates the essential-context receipt (`providers.md`) |
| `_kiro.dev/agent/switched` | `agent_switched` | `text` = new agent name |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` | `mcp_oauth_request` | `server_name`, `oauth_url` |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized` | `mcp_server_initialized` | `server_name` |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_init_failure` | `mcp_server_init_failure` | `server_name`, `text` = error |

`_process_message()` classifies these as `"compaction"`, `"clear"`, `"agent_switched"`, `"mcp_oauth_request"`, `"mcp_server_initialized"`, `"mcp_server_init_failure"` actions.
Other methods (`send_message_stream`, `send_message`) log compaction but do not yield
clear/agent events (CLI/Slack paths handle these differently).

### MCP OAuth Inline Banner

When kiro-cli needs OAuth authentication for an MCP server, `AcpClient` surfaces the flow inline:

1. `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` — captured during `_drain_notifications()` (init) and `_prompt_loop()` (mid-session). Yields `EVENT_MCP_OAUTH_REQUEST` with `serverName` + `oauthUrl`. Frontend renders an Authorize banner; kiro-cli's local callback handles the OAuth redirect.
2. `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized` — flips the banner to authenticated state. Clears the per-server dedupe entry so a future token expiry can re-prompt.
3. `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_init_failure` — flips the banner to failed state with the error string. Also clears dedupe so a retry surfaces a fresh banner.

**Dedupe**: Per-server dedupe via `_oauth_emitted_servers: set[str]` prevents kiro-cli's per-probe retries from spamming the user. Works across both buffered (init drain) and live (mid-session) paths. Cleared on new session.

**URL validation**: `_is_safe_oauth_url()` rejects non-http(s) schemes before dedupe — an unsafe URL doesn't consume the dedupe slot.

**Persistence**: Role-aware redaction (`_redact_meta_for_role`) preserves `oauth_url` for `mcp_oauth` messages so the Authorize link survives history rehydrate, while still scrubbing unsafe schemes on the read path.

**API**: `pop_pending_oauth_requests()` drains requests captured during init on
both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionProvider` (called after `ensure_ready()`).

**Remote-gateway callback relay**: The Connections waiting card and the chat `mcp_oauth` banner both accept the failed browser return address when the browser and gateway run on different machines (the banner surfaces it behind a one-line disclosure, so any server the banner names — including user-added / self-hosted ones — can recover). `POST /api/mcp/oauth/relay` sends that address from the gateway host to kiro-cli's local callback listener. The `server` field is validated with the same `_is_valid_mcp_name` rule that governs which servers can be added at all (128-char bound); it is a bounded audit label, not a registry-membership gate. The handler is intentionally not a generic proxy: it accepts only plain-HTTP URLs whose host is in the fixed loopback set the runtime callback can produce — `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `localhost` (the network host is later selected from fixed literals, never from request data) — with an explicit port ≥1024 and exactly one non-empty `code` value; it rejects userinfo, fragments, other hostnames, non-loopback addresses, oversized input, and does not follow redirects. The callback URL and authorization code are never logged or returned; SEL records only the validated server name and completed/failed outcome. Minting approval URLs remains registry-only (parked decision #4286).

## Cancellation

`cancel_session()` sends a `session/cancel` JSON-RPC notification to the agent's stdin. It is fire-and-forget — no response ID is awaited.

After the notification it answers every permission request still open (`_permission_options`) with the `cancelled` outcome, as ACP requires. goose and pi do not acknowledge a cancel while a permission request is unanswered, so without this a Stop from a surface that had not rejected the open approval first waited out the ack budget and hard-killed the harness. Each answered request gets one SEL record (`tool_name=approval_cancel`, `outcome=rejected_on_cancel`) before the answers go out: one off-loop hop for all of them, bounded by `_SEL_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. The answers are ordinary response frames through `_send_response`, so each carries the response-write no-progress bound. Both costs fall inside the cancel grace window. A cancelled pi gate dialog is recorded as denied, the same as a rejection.

### stopReason Parsing

When the ACP agent acknowledges a cancel, the `session/prompt` response carries `result.stopReason`. `_dispatch_events` reads this field on `action == "complete"` and populates `AcpEvent.stop_reason`:

- `"cancelled"` — agent honored the cancel request (`STOP_REASON_CANCELLED`)
- `"end_turn"` — normal turn completion (`STOP_REASON_END_TURN`)
- `""` — field absent or not a dict result

### Cancel Grace Window

Setting `_cancelled = True` no longer short-circuits `_read_message`. Instead, a 10-second grace window (`_CANCEL_GRACE_SECS = 10.0`) allows the agent to deliver its `stopReason` acknowledgement. If no response arrives within the window, `_read_message` raises `AcpError("Cancel grace window exceeded; agent unresponsive")`. This preserves the escape hatch for broken agents without sabotaging cooperative cancels.

`_cancel_ts` is set to `time.monotonic()` inside `cancel_session()`.

### Tool-Interruption Auto-Complete

kiro-cli's built-in security filter can cancel tool calls before they execute (e.g.
when a bash command contains sensitive keywords).  When this happens kiro-cli emits an
`agent_message_chunk` with the exact text
`Tool uses were interrupted, waiting for the next user prompt` **and then goes idle
without sending a `session/prompt` response**.  Without special handling the caller
would wait for the full 2-hour prompt timeout.

All three prompt paths (`send_message_stream`, `_dispatch_events`, `_read_prompt_response`)
detect this marker (exact stripped match, not substring, to avoid false positives when
the model quotes the text in prose) and complete the turn immediately — `_dispatch_events`
also synthesizes a final `EVENT_COMPLETE` so dashboard and CLI callers using
`stream_events` exit cleanly.  The text itself is still yielded so the user sees what
happened, and a `tool_interrupted`-tagged SEL audit event is written for the security
log since kiro-cli's cancellation is a permission decision outside Kiro Crew's control.

### Stale-turn gate (`AcpClient`)

After text has streamed (`_stale_eligible`), a turn whose stdout+stderr fall silent for `_STALE_TURN_TIMEOUT` (90s) is a candidate for "treat as complete". The bare wall-clock reap this once did false-positived on a genuinely-working-but-quiet backend (a long model generation, or a spawned build emitting nothing to the pipe), ending the turn and losing all subsequent output — the *capture*-side analogue of the same blunt-timeout defect the runtime path already fixed for tool-stall. `AcpClient` now **oracle-gates** the reap, converging onto the same `LivenessOracle` (`acp/liveness.py`) contract the shared-runtime path uses: on every silent read while `_stale_eligible`, `_consult_liveness_model_wait()` calls `oracle.check_model_wait(self._pid)` (offloaded to `subprocess_executor()` under a 10s `wait_for`; degrades to `VERDICT_UNKNOWN` on any error — fail toward reaping). Consulting on **every** silent read, not only at the 90s mark, is required: the oracle needs a prior sample to compute a CPU/IO movement delta, so with readable counters a fresh oracle's first *submitted* consult returns `UNKNOWN`/`"sampling"` and a single consult at the cutoff would always reap. A missing runtime PID or unreadable counters also return `UNKNOWN`, each with its own evidence string.

The submitted future is tracked on the client, and polls while it is unfinished return `UNKNOWN` without submitting another job — so a wedged walk can no longer submit a fresh worker on every silent read. It stays tracked until it finishes **or the next liveness-state boundary retires it**, whichever comes first; a still-pending walk is deliberately detached at a boundary rather than waited on. The residual executor-occupancy bound is therefore at most one abandoned worker per boundary — turn start or process reset — rather than one per silent read: a pathological loop of turns against a permanently wedged `/proc` read can still occupy `subprocess_executor()` workers, which teardown (`_get_child_pids`) also uses. Eliminating that entirely needs a killable per-walk process or a dedicated liveness bulkhead, neither of which this gate attempts.

Both boundaries that drop a movement baseline — turn start in `_prompt_loop()` and `_reset_state()` — **retire** the liveness state through `_retire_liveness_state()`, which releases the tracked consult future AND swaps in a fresh oracle via `LivenessOracle.fresh()` (`fresh()` rather than a default construction, so an injected `/proc` root or sampling interval survives the swap). The two must retire together: replacing only the oracle would leave a walk wedged during the previous turn answering every later poll with `"prior consult still in flight"`, so the new turn would never sample its own process and the 90s cutoff would complete it early. Clearing in place is not sufficient either — a consult detached by a timeout keeps a bound reference to the instance it was submitted with, and samples are keyed without a PID, so a late write would repopulate the live baseline after that baseline was taken; since any nonzero delta counts as movement, that reads `WORKING` for a flat turn and defers its reap. Retiring confines a late writer to an instance nobody reads, which is what makes the `"sampling"` behaviour above hold. Retirement sits inside `_prompt_loop()` immediately after `_turn_lock` is acquired, which is load-bearing twice over: it is the single point every prompt path funnels through (`send_message` via `_read_prompt_response`, `send_message_stream`, and `_dispatch_events`), so no public prompt API is left carrying the previous turn's walk; and doing it under the lock stops a queued turn from clearing the *active* turn's tracked consult and thereby allowing a second walk while the first is still pending.

A retired walk that fails afterwards has its exception consumed via a done-callback attached at submission, so an ordinary probe failure is not reported as an unhandled-asyncio crash. Past the cutoff, **only `VERDICT_WORKING`** (moving CPU/IO in the backend subprocess subtree) defers the turn (loop continues); every other verdict (`DEAD`/`UNKNOWN`/`STUCK_INPUT`) preserves the prior end-the-turn behavior, so hang recovery is never weakened — a genuinely dead turn still ends, bounded by the resolved prompt timeout (`_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`, 4h — raised alongside `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` via `resolve_prompt_timeout`) and the tool-stall watchdog below. Unlike the runtime path's `session/cancel` probe, the `AcpClient` reap is a plain `return` (process-per-session: the turn simply completes; no shared runtime to protect).

The compatibility reap emits `EVENT_COMPLETE` with `stop_reason=end_turn` so
existing consumers finalize normally, but also sets `synthetic_completion=true`.
The provenance distinguishes it from the provider's genuine `end_turn` result;
accounting consumers must reject the synthetic form.

### Tool-stall watchdog

A JSONL tool result retires its matching active call before dispatch yields the
result, even though it carries no `tool_status`. The scan
(`_read_new_tool_results_sync`) reads the file through
`jsonl_util.bounded_raw_records_with_offsets`, so one record's memory is capped
at `RECORD_CAP` and the scan resumes from a byte offset. It saves its offset past
each complete line before parsing it, and decodes each line on its own with
`errors="replace"`, so a line it cannot use costs only that line and one bad byte
cannot hold the offset in place for the rest of the session. Skipped: a record
over the cap (the offset still moves past it), a line that is not a JSON object
(malformed, nested past the decoder's ceiling), a `data`, `content` or item of
the wrong type, a result without a non-empty string `toolUseId`, a `stdout` that
is not a string, and any line whose handling raises. An unterminated last record
is left for the next scan. All JSONL flush paths update the
watchdog state on the event loop after the file read: remaining calls keep the
tool watchdog armed; the final result disarms it and re-arms stale recovery.

While a turn is dispatching, both ACP transports run a watchdog over a turn gone silent after a tool was dispatched — and both **recover** rather than just `return` on a dead turn (`AcpClient` keeps the blanket `_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT` window; the session handle is verdict-driven, below):

- **`AcpClient`** (process-per-session, `_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT = 600s`): the stall clock is measured against `_tool_last_seen = max(last_data_ts, self._last_activity)`, so tools that keepalive-ping without emitting stdout frames (`wait`, `spawn_sub_agents`) don't trip a false stall (`_last_activity` is refreshed out of band by the stderr drain / keepalive). On a real stall it `_kill_process(force=True)` and raises `AcpProcessDied`, routing through the existing pipe-death recovery (dashboard resets the session + re-queues, bounded by `_acp_pipe_death_retries`; cron/other callers get a clean error instead of a wedged slot). `_kill_process` only touches the subprocess/pipes (never `_turn_lock`), and blast radius is one session — each `AcpClient` owns exactly one process.
- **`runtime.py` / `AcpSessionHandle`**: watchdogs are **verdict-driven, not timeout-driven**; see "Session-handle watchdog" below.

#### Session-handle watchdog

| Setting | Default | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `watchdog.check_after_secs` | 60s | idle time before the oracle is consulted |
| `watchdog.stale_window_secs` | 600s | stale probe for an UNKNOWN verdict |
| `watchdog.model_silent_probe_secs` | 1800s | stale window when the evidence is `established_flat` |
| `watchdog.tool_stall_suspect_secs` | 5400s (90 min) | tool cancel for an UNKNOWN tool verdict |
| `watchdog.tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` | 7200s (2h) | hard cap, UNKNOWN only; also bounds per-agent overrides |

watchdogs are **verdict-driven, not timeout-driven** — the prior design used timeouts as death detectors and killed healthy-but-slow work (a silent 30-min redirected build `long-build > build.log 2>&1` at exactly the blanket window; healthy long non-streamed reasoning at 90s, where the destructive `session/cancel` probe was acked by the LIVE turn and surfaced as "Turn cancelled by user").

Once a turn is idle past `watchdog.check_after_secs` (60s), the per-session `LivenessOracle` (`acp/liveness.py`) returns a verdict with evidence: **WORKING** (a live cmdline-matched shell child, a kirocrew-core `wait` call inside its declared duration (at most `WAIT_TOOL_MAX_SECS`, the tool's own 1800s maximum) + slack, selected by the provenance-verified adapter identity (`ToolCallState.is_trusted_wait`) and never by the model-authored title, moving CPU/IO counters, backend socket bytes flowing) is never acted on at any elapsed time, with one exception: an opaque MCP tool's `mcp subtree active` reading (any CPU/IO movement in the runtime's tree, which a warm sibling MCP server also produces, so it cannot tell a live call from one whose result frame was lost) is bounded by `watchdog.tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` on the session's own frame clock and then gets the same session-scoped tool-stall cancel as an UNKNOWN past the cap; its metric point carries `window=working_cap`; the kirocrew-core `spawn_sub_agents`, which pings `/api/session-keepalive` for its whole run (matched by `ToolCallState.is_trusted_keepalive_tool` on the adapter identity) keeps the unbounded deferral (logged at most once per 10 min — at INFO below the escalation mark, which is the lower of 30 min and a quarter of this turn's deadline, and at WARNING past it so a deferral able to hold the turn to its ceiling is visible at the default `agent.log_level`); **DEAD** (tracked shell child exited without a result frame past a 15s grace; model-wait with flat counters and NO established backend socket — the done-but-lost-frame wedge signature) acts immediately, so recovery lands seconds after actual death instead of at a blanket window; **STUCK_INPUT** (matched subtree flat across samples with a process blocked reading a tty/stdin pipe) acts immediately with a cause the recovery nudge names; **UNKNOWN** is the only timeout-governed class — stale probe at `watchdog.stale_window_secs` (600s; extended to `watchdog.model_silent_probe_secs` = 1800s when the evidence is `established_flat`, i.e. probably a non-streamed server-side think), tool cancel at `watchdog.tool_stall_suspect_secs` (5400s / 90 min — clears every shipped budget a single tool call can legitimately spend silent, such as the task runner's 90-minute test command), hard-capped at `watchdog.tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` (7200s / 2h, UNKNOWN and opaque-MCP WORKING; also bounds the per-agent overrides).

The oracle's evidence is Linux `/proc` where it exists; on macOS (no procfs) it selects an in-process **libproc backend** once per oracle instance (`select_darwin_backend`, injectable for tests): `proc_listchildpids` enumerates the runtime's descendants, `PROC_PIDTBSDINFO` supplies ppid / zombie state / start time, `proc_pidpath` and `sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2` supply the executable and argv for the same cmdline match the `/proc` walk performs, and `PROC_PIDTASKINFO` supplies per-process CPU time summed over the subtree (evidence labelled `darwin cpu-only`, since IO bytes are not readable there). So a shell command is WORKING/DEAD/`shell_child_absent` on macOS by the same rules as Linux, and an active MCP subtree reads WORKING instead of running out the suspect window; evidence only `/proc` carries — the `established_flat` socket tag, the `blocked_read_fd` STUCK_INPUT check, `wchan` — is never invented on macOS: a flat model wait keeps the plain UNKNOWN, and a live tracked shell child whose subtree is flat is UNKNOWN tagged `platform_limited` — bounded by the standard no-progress budget — rather than WORKING, because without stdin-block evidence a stuck child and a quiet one are one state and "alive" must not buy an indefinite deferral (see "Platform evidence matrix" below).

Dispatch stamps on darwin are wall-clock (`time.time()`), the clock libproc dates processes on, and a wall clock can step: a backward NTP or VM-resume correction between the dispatch stamp and the runtime's fork dates a live child before its own dispatch. The stamp is therefore paired with a steady one (`steady_now()`, darwin `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, which counts sleep), and when wall elapsed and steady elapsed disagree by more than the attribution tolerance the oracle declines to attribute by start time at all — every row reads as possibly this tool's, so a matched child stays WORKING and no `shell_child_absent` claim is made. A missing steady stamp gets the same fail-open answer.

**Windows has no tree backend yet**: the oracle there reads only the runtime's own CPU time (`proc_cpu_nanos_for_pid` via `GetProcessTimes`, root pid only), so every shell and MCP tool call stays UNKNOWN — tagged `platform_limited` so the degradation is visible in the evidence and the metric bucket — and the 90-minute suspect window is the effective tool timeout on that platform (narrowed to the ordinary silence window when the command was classified prompt-shaped, see "Interactive-command policy" below) — a genuinely hung non-interactive tool holds its slot for that long. The trade is accepted rather than sized around: a Toolhelp-based descendant walk is the follow-up that closes it, the same way the darwin backend did for macOS.

Four refinements keep the build-scale tool forbearance from sheltering an **LLM-shaped** stall (a model turn riding inside a tool, e.g. kiro-cli `use_subagent`, whose longest legitimate silent gap is minutes) or an **already-finished** one: (1) the oracle tags an UNKNOWN tool verdict with `established_flat` when the subtree's counters are genuinely flat (a real two-sample delta, not the baseline tick) AND the **runtime process itself** holds an established backend socket — deliberately narrower than the model-wait branch's whole-tree socket scan, so an MCP server's own remote call is not read as a model wait (refinement (4) handles that shape separately) — and the tool branch then uses `min(model_silent_probe_secs, tool_stall_suspect_secs)` as the effective suspect window; plain flat-subtree evidence keeps the full window, and under the OS sandbox (pid = launcher parent, no sockets on it) the tag never fires, failing toward the long build-safe window.

(2) the never-matched SHELL fork is split instead of uniformly forgiven: `no matching shell child` conflated a command that already exited — a sub-second `ls | grep | wc` whose result frame was lost is never observed alive, so the DEAD branch's 15s exit grace can never fire for it — with one running unrecognized, and the two got the same 1h. The oracle now tags the first case `shell_child_absent` when the runtime's descendant tree is OBSERVABLE (a readable `/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children`, empty or not) and holds no live descendant attributable to this dispatch, and the tool branch then uses `min(stale_window_secs, tool_stall_suspect_secs)` — the ordinary silence budget — instead of the build-scale one. Attribution compares a descendant's `starttime` against a `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` stamp taken at the tool_call frame and widened by the turn's banked consumer parking (`_parked_total`), because `/proc` dates processes on a clock that counts suspended time while `time.monotonic()` does not, and the stamp is taken when the frame is PROCESSED rather than when the runtime spawned (a frame queued behind an approval is stamped that late). Four states each keep the full window, so every unattributable one fails toward build-scale patience: a descendant young enough to be this dispatch's, one whose cmdline matches while predating the stamp (indistinguishable from a coincidental lookalike), an unreadable child list, and a missing stamp or tick rate (no `os.sysconf` off Linux). The verdict stays UNKNOWN, never DEAD — absence is inferred, so it only shortens the non-lethal cancel.

(3) An agent definition can override the windows per agent (`agents.<name>.watchdog_tool_stall_suspect_secs` / `watchdog_tool_stall_hard_cap_secs`, 0 = inherit the global — the same empty-inherits convention as the agent's `model`), applied in the `WatchdogSettings` snapshot at handle construction (`_load_watchdog_settings(crew_agent)` — a direct lookup on the CANONICAL crew name, resolved by the surface that owns the identity: the dashboard passes the slot member explicitly through `get_or_create(crew_agent=...)`, and crew-name-passing surfaces (Slack threads, cron, spawned agents) are covered by the provider factory's crew-namespace membership fallback; the identity is plumbed provider → runtime → handle, and a warm-pool claim rebinds the live handle via `rebind_watchdog()` so it travels with the SESSION, not the pool key — a name that is not a crew key simply inherits the global) so a pure-LLM agent like a PR reviewer can declare minutes-scale windows without touching the global build budget; an override is bounded by the same load-time ceiling clamp as the global windows, so it cannot smuggle a window past the prompt timeout.

(4) An opaque MCP tool whose subtree is genuinely flat while a TOOL-side process holds an established TCP connection to a non-loopback peer is tagged `remote_flat` — the shape of a tool blocked on its own remote call, which with no client timeout holds the call until the build-scale window. The tag needs the handle to declare a socket tenancy of exactly one session (`socket_tenancy=AcpSessionHandle._socket_tenancy`, which counts registered sessions, initializing ones and unsettled starts, and declares nothing while `watchdog.remote_flat_probe_secs` is 0, so with the key off the tag, its metric bucket and the window never appear), because the scan reads the whole tree and a co-tenant's or riding subagent's socket must not shorten this session's window. It is a separate declaration from the oracle's `tenancy`, so the model-wait DEAD fast path is unchanged. "Tool side" excludes the runtime pid and, when that pid holds no socket at all (the Linux namespace sandbox's launcher parent), its direct children too, so kiro-cli's own model connection never counts, and a loopback peer (Kiro Crew's gateway, which in-tree MCP servers such as `spawn_sub_agents` block on for their whole run) never counts either; on macOS the socket view is `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDLISTFDS)` + `proc_pidfdinfo(PROC_PIDFDSOCKETINFO)` (`darwin_established_tcp_count`, refused on any fill size other than the 792-byte `socket_fdinfo`), and Windows has no socket view so the tag never fires there. The tool branch then uses `min(watchdog.remote_flat_probe_secs, tool_stall_suspect_secs)` when the key is above 0. It is **off by default** (0): the connection is read from the whole tree, so another MCP server's persistent connection (a keepalive, `mcp-remote`) or a shell tool's background tunnel can hold the tag while a quiet tool of a different server runs; tying the holder to the in-flight tool's own server (`_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`) is what would make it safe to enable by default. 900s is the suggested opt-in value. That value is shorter than `model_silent_probe_secs` (1800s) on purpose: that window is sized for a documented shape, kiro-cli's own non-streamed extended-effort think, while a flat tool waiting on a remote peer has no such contract and is most often a call with no client timeout; a deployment whose MCP tools legitimately block longer (a long-poll API, a non-streaming model behind a third-party server) raises the key, and the recovery on expiry is the non-lethal continue-nudge, not a lost turn. The window is measured from the later of the last own frame and the last probe that read the tree as WORKING, so a slow stream that moves bytes between flat samples keeps the full window; the full suspect window still applies as an upper bound. Every idle window is bounded at load by the resolved prompt timeout (`resolve_prompt_timeout` — the one deadline every caller shares; 14400s default, following a raised `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`) minus 10% headroom for the cancel + ack grace, and an over-ceiling on-disk value is clamped with a warning: a window at or past the deadline makes the UNKNOWN class unreachable, because the turn's timeout fires first and the user gets the generic turn-limit card instead of the tool-stall recovery below. A window above the DASHBOARD ceiling (`agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`) is reported but **not** clamped — the same handle serves callers that pass their own larger prompt timeout, and shrinking their windows would cancel live work. **Every watchdog action is non-lethal:** a stale probe's cancel-ack is reclassified in the turn-complete branch (`_stale_probe` + `stopReason==cancelled` → `STOP_REASON_STALE_RECOVER`; the flag is single-shot — consumed on reclassification and superseded by a genuine `cancel()`, so a user cancel arriving after a probe is never misattributed to auto-recovery) so the dashboard auto-recovers instead of logging a user cancellation — an oracle mistake costs a regeneration, never a session. A tool stall ends the turn with `STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL` (`"error: tool stall"`, in the `error:` family so branch-less callers degrade to generic handling) carrying the tool title / redacted command / evidence on the terminal `AcpEvent`; chat_runner's dedicated branch queues a **continue-nudge** (`build_tool_stall_recovery_prompt` — check partial results, tail any `> file` redirect target, re-run non-interactively on STUCK_INPUT) instead of the legacy verbatim re-queue of the original user message (which restarted the whole task and re-ran the very command that stalled), charged against a separate `slot._tool_stall_retries` budget (3) so a stall never burns the pipe-death reconnect budget. The runtime is **shared** (multiple sessions multiplexed on one process), so recovery is always `session/cancel` for **this `sessionId` only** (bounded by `asyncio.wait_for(..., 5s)`); siblings keep running. `watchdog.*` config is snapshotted at handle construction (`WatchdogSettings`); the dispatch loop never reads config. The snapshot is **re-bound on a config reload**, so a live handle does not keep boot's windows until its turn ends: `SessionManager._rebind_live_watchdogs(cfg)` fires when a reload touches `watchdog.*`, `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`, or any `agents.<name>.watchdog_*` key, walks every registered session's provider (`_watchdog_handle_of` resolves both shapes — `AcpSessionProvider._handle` and `AcpProvider._client._handle`) and calls `handle.rebind_watchdog(crew, _load_watchdog_settings(crew, cfg=cfg))`. It re-runs the loader for the handle's OWN crew identity rather than copying raw seconds across, so the per-agent override overlay and the prompt-timeout ceiling clamp above are re-applied per handle — a raised `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` lifts the ceiling that was clamping a window, and a lowered one re-clamps it. The config is the one the watcher already loaded, so the fan-out touches no disk on the loop, and the dispatch loop reads the snapshot every tick, so the new windows govern the next check. A handle that raises is skipped and logged at DEBUG; the rest still rebind.

The tool watchdog remains armed while any dispatched tool-call ID is in flight.
Only a terminal result removes that ID; partial output and interleaved model text
do not arm model-wait recovery. After the last call finishes, model-wait recovery
is armed even if the model never sends another text chunk. The shared handle
retains each live call's attribution so either completion order leaves the
watchdog inspecting a surviving call.

**Both idle clocks measure BACKEND silence, so consumer time is subtracted from them.** `_dispatch_events` is an async generator: it is suspended at its `yield` for the whole of a consumer-side await (a tool approval, an IM send, a hook), and `last_data_ts` does not advance while suspended. Charging that interval to the runtime lets the arm cancel a turn moments *after* a human approves a tool — and at that instant the tool has not started, so the oracle draws `UNKNOWN` or `DEAD`, and `DEAD` acts immediately regardless of the window. `prompt()` therefore times each park around its single re-yield (`_parked_since` → `_parked_total`, cleared in a `finally` so an abandoned generator does not read as parked forever), and the timeout arm subtracts the park accumulated since `last_data_ts` was taken. The tool clock is exact; the stale clock can key off the newer stderr/keepalive activity, in which case part of the correction predates its reference point and is subtracted twice — which only makes that branch more patient, never quicker to probe.

**On the shared runtime the tool clock is also SESSION-SCOPED.** `AcpRuntime._reader_loop` marks a frame `fanout_no_owner` when it fans an ownerless frame (no `sessionId`) out to more than one registered session — a lone session is the sole owner and stays unmarked, so a single-session runtime behaves exactly as before. The dispatch loop advances a session-attributable twin of the pair, `last_own_data_ts` / `parked_at_own_data`, only for an unmarked frame, and both the **tool-idle clock** and the **post-compaction-failure budget** read that twin: a co-tenant's roster broadcast (`_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update`) can no longer defer either on traffic this session never produced. The tool-idle clock also takes the session's own keepalive stamp, `AcpSessionHandle.note_keepalive()`, which `AcpSessionProvider.touch_activity()` sets from `/api/session-keepalive` — the ping `wait` and `spawn_sub_agents` send while they block, since a blocking tool emits no frame. A co-tenant's keepalive stamps only its own handle, so it never defers this session. The stamp records the consumer park accumulated up to the touch, an open park included, so the clock subtracts only park time after it and stays exact. The **stale** clock deliberately keeps reading `last_data_ts`, because it already folds in the runtime-wide `_last_activity` (bumped on every stdout line), so runtime-global traffic is inside its contract by construction. Provenance, not the frame's method, is the discriminator — the same notification kind can arrive routed (this session's own progress) or fanned out (a co-tenant's), and only the runtime knows which. The events a marked frame yields carry that provenance to the consumer as `AcpEvent.runtime_global` — the roster, the compaction, clear and agent-switch notices, the steer echoes, and (by the stricter must-name-this-session test) the MCP registration notifications — so a consumer that measures this session's own activity or its startup can tell a co-tenant's frame from its own. A `session/update` names its session by protocol and is routed, so its events leave the flag clear. The one remaining over-count is deliberate and bounded: the tool branch's TOCTOU guard cannot know the owner of a frame that arrives *during* the oracle await (it is not dequeued yet), so it advances both clocks and defers by a single tick, the same fail-safe trade `_ingress_seq` documents at its increment. A keepalive that lands during the await voids the verdict the same way; it is attributed to this session, so it moves only the tool clock, to the touch's stamp.

**The turn's park is readable from outside the turn.** `parked_for_secs()`, `parked_since`, and `awaiting_permission` exist because this arm cannot report on itself: it only advances when a consumer pulls the generator, so a consumer-side await freezes it and it never executes again for that turn. `session.md`'s `stuck_turn` hook reads those accessors from a loop with its own timer. Answering a permission calls `_end_human_wait()`, which banks the human's thinking time into `_parked_total` and restarts `_parked_since`, so the in-band correction stays exact while the external reading counts only what the consumer itself has spent since the answer.

Both transports offload the oracle consult to `subprocess_executor()`, so both carry the same two obligations, and both discharge them through ONE shared guard — `liveness.consult_offloaded()`, which owns the prior-future check, the in-try submission, the submission-time exception callback, the shielded bounded await, and the degrade-to-UNKNOWN arm, so a fix to that sequence lands at both call sites at once (each caller keeps only which oracle check runs and where its tracked future lives). **One outstanding walk per liveness generation:** `_consult_oracle_offloaded()` tracks the submitted future and answers `UNKNOWN`/`"prior consult still in flight"` on any tick that finds it unfinished, so a `/proc` read wedged on a stuck fd no longer adds a blocked worker every `check_after_secs` to the pool teardown's `_get_child_pids` also draws from. The no-in-flight-tool answer is resolved *before* that guard, because it is pure handle state and needs no worker. Its exception is retrieved via a callback attached at submission — not in an `except Exception` arm, which `CancelledError` (a `BaseException`) would skip — so a probe that fails after its awaiter left is not recorded as an unhandled-asyncio crash. **Retire, don't `reset()`:** turn start in `prompt()` and every new tool dispatch call `_retire_liveness_state()`, releasing the tracked future *together with* the oracle (`LivenessOracle.fresh()`, so the per-session `wellness_sample_secs` survives). Splitting them either way is a defect: clearing the oracle in place leaves a detached walk writing into the live baseline (samples are keyed without a PID, and any nonzero delta counts as movement), while replacing only the oracle leaves a walk wedged in the previous generation answering every later tick "still in flight" so the new generation never samples its own process. The tool path has a sharper version of the first hazard than the capture path does: a walk carrying the *previous* tool's `ToolCallState` matches a descendant of the previous command and stores it as `_tracked_child`, after which `_check_shell_child` reports `WORKING "shell child N alive"` for the new tool against an unrelated process. Retirement is not a change to the cross-tick tracked-child contract itself — `fresh()` starts in exactly the state `reset()` produced, and the consult binds `self._oracle` at submission, so ticks after a boundary accumulate on the new instance as before.

watchdogs above are inside the generator, so a new consumer-side await silently
widens the class of failure neither of them can see; the note records which
failure classes are detectable here and which must be judged out of band.

### Platform evidence matrix (declared degradation)

The oracle's evidence differs per host, and every gap is DECLARED rather than
inferred: an absent row never yields `DEAD` or `STUCK_INPUT`, and never yields
`WORKING` on process liveness alone. The table is the contract the module
docstring of `acp/liveness.py` carries and `test_acp_liveness*.py` pins
(RFC `rfc-overload-resilience.md` §14.9).

| Evidence | Linux (`/proc`) | macOS (`libproc`) | Windows (no tree backend) | Declared degradation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| process tree | `task/*/children` (`iter_descendants`) | `proc_listchildpids` (`LibprocBackend`) | absent | Windows: every shell/MCP tool verdict is `UNKNOWN` tagged `platform_limited`, bounded by the no-progress budget |
| shell child match / exit | cmdline + `starttime` | argv/path + start time | absent | same |
| subtree movement | CPU jiffies + IO bytes | CPU ns only | root-pid CPU (model-wait probe only) | a moving subtree is `WORKING` on any host: "no output" alone never kills a task whose CPU/IO moves |
| blocked on stdin (`STUCK_INPUT`) | `wchan` + blocked fd; a stdin pipe reader whose pipe has a live writer in the watched subtree (`producer \| consumer`) is a producer wait, not `STUCK_INPUT` (procfs only) | absent | absent | a live tracked shell child whose subtree is FLAT (real two-sample delta) is `UNKNOWN` tagged `platform_limited`, never `WORKING` — "alive" is never sufficient for indefinite deferral |
| socket / LLM wait (`established_flat`) | `/proc/net` established → `UNKNOWN` or `DEAD` | absent → plain `UNKNOWN`, never `DEAD` | absent | same |
| socket / remote call (`remote_flat`) | fd inodes + `/proc/net` established, non-loopback peer, sole tenant → `UNKNOWN` tagged | `PROC_PIDFDSOCKETINFO` established, non-loopback peer, sole tenant → `UNKNOWN` tagged | absent → never tagged | same |
| business progress | stream events, `kirocrew/status` | same | same | platform-independent; outranks every row above |

Consequences in the dispatch loop: `platform_limited` is an `UNKNOWN`, so
the standard bounded budget governs it — `tool_stall_suspect_secs` capped by
`tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` — exactly as for any untagged `UNKNOWN`. The one
narrowing keyed on it is conditional on the tool layer: when the dispatched
shell command was classified prompt-shaped (below), the window narrows to
`stale_window_secs`, because that is the case the missing stdin evidence would
have answered. The tag has its own closed metric bucket
(`evidence_class=platform_limited` on `kirocrew.watchdog.action`) so the
degradation is visible in telemetry rather than folded into `degraded`.

### Interactive-command policy (W4 `waiting_input`)

The tool layer classifies a SHELL command **before** it runs
(`liveness.classify_interactive_command`, keyed on the trusted
`AcpEvent.shell_command`, never the LLM-authored title). The classifier is a
table of known programs, not a rewrite of arbitrary flags: pagers (`less`,
`man`, `git log|diff|show|blame|…` without `-P`/`--no-pager` and with a
terminal stdout), editors (`vim`, `nano`, `git commit` without `-m`, `git
rebase -i`), REPLs that read stdin when given nothing to run (`python`,
`node`, `psql`, `cat`, …), package-manager confirmations (`apt-get install`
without `-y`, `pacman -S` without `--noconfirm`, `pip uninstall`, `npm init`,
…) and credential prompts (`sudo` without `-n`, `ssh`/`scp` without
`BatchMode=yes`, `gpg` without `--batch`, `docker login`, `gh auth login`, `aws
configure`). It yields an `InteractiveClassification` — `risk`, `program`,
`reason`, a non-interactive **hint**, `side_effecting` — carried on
`ToolCallState.interactive_risk` and `AcpSessionHandle.inflight_interactive`.
A pager is advisory only (under the tool, stdout is a pipe, so a pager degrades
to `cat` on its own); the other four classes are `INTERACTIVE_NARROWING_RISKS`.

The classifier never rewrites the command. The repo has no environment layer on
the ACP tool path — the hook gate (`ToolHookResult`) can only allow or deny, and
the `GIT_PAGER=cat` layer in `dashboard/terminal_commands.py` serves the human
terminal — so `PAGER=cat` / `-y` / the ssh options are PROPOSED via the hint the
recovery nudge carries, not applied. Applying them at the harness is a
follow-up seam, not a matcher's job.

The ssh hint does not propose `BatchMode=yes`. Once case is folded, that option
name contains a permission verb, so a proposed `ssh -o BatchMode=yes … /usr/…` is
refused by the permission deny rows. The hint proposes `-o
StrictHostKeyChecking=yes -o NumberOfPasswordPrompts=0 -o
PasswordAuthentication=no -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no` instead, aimed at
the prompts ssh_config(5) says BatchMode disables: password prompts and host key
confirmation. The classifier still counts only `BatchMode` as proof that ssh will
not prompt. A command using the proposed options stays prompt-shaped, because a
FIDO/sk key PIN or an encrypted key's passphrase may still be asked for under
them, and the conservative reading keeps the shorter stall window. A
permission-row refusal whose command spells `BatchMode` carries remediation text
naming the same options (`deny_guidance.SSH_BATCHMODE_REMEDIATION`). The rows
themselves are unchanged, so that spelling is still refused.

**Post-stall classification.** When the tool branch acts, the stall is a wait
for input on exactly two grounds: the oracle's own `STUCK_INPUT` (Linux), or a
`platform_limited` no-progress verdict on a command whose classification is
narrowing-eligible. Either yields an `EVENT_STRUCTURED_STATUS` carrying a
`StructuredStatus{phase=waiting, wait_reason=waiting_input,
origin=liveness_oracle, cancellable=True, resumable=False, safe_retry}` **before**
any action, so a scheduler can release the lane slot on it; a flat build with
no interactive classification stays an opaque tool stall (no status). Then
`WatchdogSettings.interactive_command_policy` decides: `cancel` (the default —
today's non-lethal `session/cancel` + `STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL`, whose terminal
carries the same `status`), or `wait` (keep the turn open for real input; the
blocked process is kept and its residency stays charged; the bound is the
turn's own ceiling, i.e. the task's `deadline_at` — the hard cap does not
cancel a declared input wait). Neither policy answers anything: no `yes`, no
Enter, no synthesized stdin. `safe_retry` is True only when the classifier's
read-only verdict holds AND the call streamed no output
(`_tool_output_seen`); a command that printed may have acted, so a
non-interactive retry is never proposed as safe, and any retry stays inside the
already-granted approval scope with the original parameters. The config key
behind the policy is `agent.interactive_command_policy` (`config/sections.py`,
read by `_load_watchdog_settings`); the snapshot field is the seam.

### Structured status protocol (`kirocrew/status`, version 1)

Existing signals are reused as-is — `session/update` for tool-call
start/complete and agent text, `_kiro.dev/metadata` for the harness
`stopReason`, `_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` for native sub-agent identity,
MCP `notifications/progress` routed per request by `mcp_gateway/backend.py`.
None carries a wait reason or a resume condition, so one versioned extension is
added under `params._meta["kirocrew/status"]` (or the inner `update._meta`,
where kiro-cli carries `_meta.kiro`):

```text
"kirocrew/status": { version: 1,
  task_id, session_id, parent_id, tool_call_id, generation,
  phase: starting|running|waiting|recovering,
  wait_reason: waiting_input|waiting_permission|waiting_dependency|waiting_children|retry_wait   # iff waiting
  dependency_scope, retry_at (epoch secs),
  progress_source: tool_output|stream_event|checkpoint|process_evidence,
  cancellable, resumable, safe_retry,   # each defaults False: saying nothing grants nothing
  checkpoint_ref }
```

`StructuredStatus.from_meta` (`acp/types.py`) owns the shape and the version
gate: an unsupported `version` rejects the WHOLE frame (a newer schema is never
half-applied), an unknown `phase` or a non-vocabulary `wait_reason` rejects it,
a `wait_reason` outside the waiting phase is dropped, non-bool capabilities are
False, a non-int `generation` is 0, a non-finite `retry_at` is None, string
fields are bounded to 512 chars and unknown fields are ignored. The parsed
record is an `AcpEvent(kind=EVENT_STRUCTURED_STATUS, status=…)` and
`AcpEvent.status` also rides a tool-stall terminal (above).

**Origin rule** (`AcpSessionHandle._structured_status_event`): a status is
trusted only from the execution layer of the session it names. It is accepted
iff the frame was ROUTED to this session (`msg.fanout_no_owner` is False — an
ownerless frame fanned out to several co-tenants names no owner), the frame's
`sessionId` is this handle's (a child-routed frame is rejected as
`child_origin`: the native child's boundary is the parent, see below), the
frame is not a model-text frame (`agent_message_chunk` / `agent_thought_chunk`
— a wait is never created by anything arriving alongside prose), the
extension's `session_id` is empty or equal to this session's, and the version
gate passes. Model text that spells out the wire shape is text and nothing
else. Every rejection is counted per reason (`status_rejections`) and logged as
`status_rejected` once per reason per turn; an absent extension is silent. An
old harness that never sends the frame degrades to today's evidence — transport
heartbeat, process liveness, stream events — which the oracle already separates
from business progress.

**MCP side (not implemented).** Only the ACP `session/update` `kirocrew/status`
carrier is parsed. The MCP carrier — the same object as `_meta.kirocrew_status`
on a `notifications/progress` sibling for a tool's `progressToken` — is not
parsed. If it is added, the parser is shared (`StructuredStatus.from_meta` over
the `_meta` dict), and the origin check is "the routed `progressToken` belongs to
a tool call this session issued"; the gateway backend already routes that
notification to the requesting session. A tool result body containing the shape is content, never status.

**Consumers.** `providers/acp.py` forwards `AcpEvent.status` unchanged. The main chat's tool-stall continuation (`chat_runner`) takes `stuck_input` from `status.wait_reason == waiting_input` on the terminal completion before the evidence-text marker; the sub-agent run loop yields its lane slot on an `EVENT_STRUCTURED_STATUS` frame with `waiting_input` (`WaitRecord.input(tool_call_id)`, residency kept — [subagent.md](subagent.md) § Typed input wait) and steers its recovery prompt from the same field.

### Harness-native subtasks: inventory and recovery boundary

Inventory of what each backend exposes for subtasks that run INSIDE the harness
(kiro-cli `use_subagent`, the Claude adapter's in-harness task tool), as
opposed to `spawn_run` / `spawn_sub_agents` tasks Kiro Crew manages
(RFC §14.8, parity row H16 in
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md); pinned by
`test_native_subagent_boundary.py`):

| Backend | Identity | Tool events | Cancel | Resume | Counting / scheduler treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| kiro-cli (`ACP_BACKEND_KIRO`) `use_subagent` | yes — `_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` roster (`sessionId`, `status`), and child-routed `session/update` / `_kiro.dev/session/update` frames carry the child `sessionId` (`AcpEvent.sub_session_id`) | attributable: child frames are parsed with the shared parser into origin-scoped caches and re-tagged `EVENT_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY`; child approvals surface on the PARENT with `sub_session_id` set (`run.py` counts them separately) | parent only — `session/cancel` on the parent session takes every child | none independent of the parent | not a task row. `AcpSessionHandle.native_child_sessions` counts child ids seen this turn through `_note_native_child` at three execution-layer seams — the child-routed branch of `_handle_update`, the `_kiro.dev/session/update` child stream in `_dispatch_events`, and the `subagent_list` roster when this handle is its sole owner (`fanout_no_owner` False; a fanned-out roster is counted on nobody) — never from model text. No `HostBudget` charge, because a child lives inside the parent's already-charged runtime process; `report_native_children(budget)` reports the count as `uncharged["native_children"]`. Recovery boundary = the parent session. A child-routed `kirocrew/status` is rejected (`child_origin`), never re-attributed |
| KAS (`ACP_BACKEND_KAS`) | yes — `_meta.kiro.agentSubtaskId` / `pipeline` on parent `tool_call` frames (`_handle_kas_subagent`), roster keyed by `agentSubtaskId` | child nested tool frames emit an activity prefix and populate the caches | parent only | none | same boundary as kiro-cli; every roster entry (individual `agent-subtask` frame or pipeline stage) is counted through the same `_note_native_child` seam |
| Claude backend (`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`) | no per-child ACP identity today — the Task tool is an ordinary `tool_call` on the parent | no | parent only | none | same boundary; the counter stays 0 because the harness exposes nothing to count, not because nothing runs. A declared capability gap (H16), not a defect: the liveness oracle bounds the parent turn identically (`test_claude_backend_counts_no_children_but_oracle_still_bounds_the_parent`) |
| `spawn_run` / `spawn_sub_agents` (all backends) | task rows (`taskq`) | yes | per task | per task (continuable) | full scheduling. A `spawn_run` child that itself uses `use_subagent` is the boundary for ITS native grandchildren: they are counted on the child's handle only, never on the grandparent |

The minimal recovery boundary for every native subtask is therefore the parent
session: it is counted there, cancelled there, and recovered there. Concretely:

- **Counted, bounded.** `native_child_sessions` holds at most
  `NATIVE_CHILD_ROSTER_CAP` (4096) distinct ids per turn; ids past the cap are
  counted in `native_child_overflow`, not stored. Non-string, empty, over-long
  (>128) and own-session ids are ignored. Both reset at the top of every turn.
  That set is the SINGLE bound on every native-child store on the handle:
  `_note_native_child` **returns** whether the id is tracked after the call
  (True also for the ordinary re-report of a known id, so its row still
  updates), and the KAS display roster `_kas_subagent_roster` writes a row only
  for a True answer. A row the counted set does not hold could never be
  recognised as a duplicate, so it would reintroduce exactly the unbounded
  growth the cap refuses — and the parent's own id, refused by the count, must
  not render the session as a sub-agent of itself. The frame stays a PARENT
  sub-agent frame either way and still emits its `EVENT_SUBAGENT_LIST` (returning
  `None` would re-render it as an ordinary tool call). A row cap bounds memory
  only when the row does too, so every backend-authored display string STORED in
  a row (name, title, status) is clipped to `NATIVE_CHILD_LABEL_CAP` (512) at the
  write, not at a render site downstream.
- **Never charged.** `HostBudget.report_uncharged(kind, count, label=)` records
  observed-but-uncharged residency per `(kind, label)` — idempotent (a re-report
  replaces), zero removes, 256 labels per kind — and `snapshot()["uncharged"]`
  exposes `{kind: total}` for health ("native children (uncharged)"). It touches
  no `procs` / `rss_mb` / `fds` counter and no admission decision; a parent with
  200 native children admits exactly what it admitted with none, and contributes
  one `record_start` / one `record_completion` to the adaptive controller, so
  the timeout-rate signal cannot be tripped by fan-out.
- **Never a lane slot or a task row.** The handle module imports neither
  `taskq` nor `admission` (structural pin), and a child's frames yield only
  `EVENT_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY` / `EVENT_SUBAGENT_LIST` — no `EVENT_TOOL_CALL`,
  `EVENT_COMPLETE` or `EVENT_STRUCTURED_STATUS` a runner would act on.
- **One cancel.** `cancel()` sends a single `session/cancel` naming the parent;
  the tool-stall watchdog recovers a stalled parent with that same single cancel
  however many children it fanned out. There is no per-child lever to send.
- **No independent resume.** `native_child_resume_refusal(conversation_id)`
  returns a typed `native_child_not_resumable: <id> is a harness-native child of
  session <parent> …` for a `spawn_continue`-style resume naming a child id, or
  `None` when the id is not this handle's child.
  `ContinuationCoordinator.native_child_resume_refusal` asks every live
  handle (the session provider's `client`) and `continue_conversation` returns
  that typed error BEFORE the `conversation_gone` lookup miss;
  `POST /api/spawn/{id}/continue` and `/steer` answer 409
  `native_child_not_resumable` for such an id (404 `conversation_gone` /
  `not_found` stay for ids nobody owns).
- **Recognised under the SAME cap, and the refusal says which.**
  `AcpRuntime._snapshot_subagent_sessions` recognises at most
  `NATIVE_CHILD_ROSTER_CAP` distinct ids from a `subagent/list_update` — the same
  number the handle counts under, never a tighter per-frame slice. Membership is
  what the routing branch decides a child's approvals on, so a tighter bound
  would split ONE announced roster into two governance classes by list position:
  an unrecognised id's `session/update` is a counted drop (empty caches, so every
  auto-approve path falls to the interactive card) and its permission request is
  auto-rejected without reaching the approval pipeline. Ids past the cap are
  counted in `_subagent_roster_overflow` and reported through
  `_note_roster_overflow`, which is **loud once per truncation EPISODE and
  throttled after that** — never one record per truncated id, and never one per
  FRAME. Both would be the retention hazard the drop counter below exists to
  avoid, one level louder: per id, a single backend-controlled frame is worth
  thousands of WARNING lines; per frame, `subagent/list_update` is a
  backend-controlled notification kiro-cli re-broadcasts on every child status
  change, so above the cap the warning is a steady state at the backend's frame
  rate. Measured on the handler with the throttle removed: 10 over-cap snapshots →
  10 identical WARNING records (~245 message bytes each), with the tail count
  holding at 40 — the log VOLUME grows, the number does not. So the first
  truncated snapshot of an episode is a `WARNING` naming the count (a truncated
  tail is otherwise indistinguishable from a roster that never named those
  children, and an operator must see it to decide whether to raise the cap), and
  every later truncated snapshot is tallied into one throttled `DEBUG` summary
  carrying how many snapshots repeated and the LARGEST tail they named. The
  summary rides the same interval as the unroutable-frame summary below
  (`_ROSTER_OVERFLOW_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` is bound to
  `_DROP_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS`, 60s) and the same shape: a monotonic window, no
  timer task on the demux loop, and a residual flush — on the episode's end and in
  `_reader_loop`'s `finally` — so a storm that stops inside one interval still
  reports more than its first frame. The peak, not the latest tail, because sizing
  the cap reads the worst case. The auto-reject reason then names which case it
  was: `roster_overflow_auto_reject` when the last snapshot truncated,
  `unregistered_session_auto_reject` when it did not, so the one signal that a cap
  truncation cost a real approval is not lost in ordinary unknown-session traffic.
  The COUNT is SNAPSHOT-scoped — the frame is the backend's full list, so it is
  replaced (idempotent under a repeated roster, even above the cap) and cleared
  when the owning session unregisters; a sticky count would invent cap pressure on
  a runtime whose roster is empty. The LOG is EPISODE-scoped, and the episode's
  boundary is exactly that count returning to 0: a roster inside the cap, or the
  owner unregistering. One lifetime governs both halves of the same signal, so the
  loud line and the auto-reject reason can never disagree about whether the cap is
  under pressure, and the first truncation after a recovery is loud again rather
  than swallowed. A plain per-interval re-arm is the alternative and is what the
  drop counter does, but that summary is `DEBUG`: re-arming a WARNING on a timer
  restates it every interval for as long as the steady state lasts, which is the
  volume being removed. One residual stated rather than implied: a tail that GROWS
  inside one episode (40 ids, later 40000) is loud only at its first value, and the
  growth shows up as the summary's peak at `DEBUG`; re-warning on growth would need
  a second threshold, i.e. a second throttle shape in a module that already has
  one. A second residual, on ownership: a roster that arrived FANNED OUT (several
  sessions registered, so no owner is provable) has no owner to unregister, so it —
  like `_subagent_sessions` itself, whose lifecycle this shares — survives until
  the next snapshot, and a denial in that window is attributed to a cap truncation
  nobody owns. Attribution only: routing still requires a provable owner. Pinned by
  `test_native_subagent_boundary.py` (the cap and the two reasons end to end) and
  `test_acp_runtime.py` (one warning per episode however many frames re-announce
  it, the throttled summary's count and peak, both ways an episode ends re-arming
  the warning, and the attribution expiring with the snapshot that earned it).
- **Observed, not scheduled.** On a shared runtime with several registered
  sessions, an unannounced child frame names no owner and is dropped (counted by
  `_note_dropped_frame`); the count is best-effort and a display never implies
  the scheduler can pause one child.

The UI showing per-child cards (`_native_subagent_sync` in `chat_runner.py`)
never implies the scheduler can pause or restart one child; a backend that later
exposes per-child cancel/resume is integrated by adding a row adapter. On a
shared runtime, recovery of the parent rebuilds only that session handle, never
the runtime shared with unrelated sessions.

### Model-substitution advisory

kiro can return a `-32603` error that is an *advisory* that it substituted a different model, not a fatal failure. `_is_model_substitution_advisory()` (with `_extract_advisory_detail()` for the human-readable reason) recognizes this shape, and the session stays alive and continues the turn instead of tearing down — a real fatal error still propagates.

## Session Update Handling

`_extract_text_chunk()` handles two update types for text streaming:

- `agent_message_chunk` — standard text/content. Detects `type: "thinking"` or `"reasoning"` content blocks for extended thinking (kiro-cli style).
- `agent_thought_chunk` — dedicated reasoning update emitted by `claude-agent-acp`. Always treated as thinking content.

`_track_usage_update()` tracks context window usage from `usage_update` session events, reconciling the frame via the shared `parse_usage_update()` (flat `update.used`/`update.size` primary, nested `update.usage.*` fallback) so `AcpClient` and `AcpRuntime` read the same shape regardless of which kiro emits. A `KNOWN_SESSION_UPDATES` frozenset in `acp/types.py` suppresses false "unhandled session update" logs for plumbing-only update kinds (`plan`, `available_commands_update`, `current_mode_update`, `config_option_update`, `session_info_update`, `user_message_chunk`, `tool_call_update`). Only genuinely unknown kinds are logged. On the **KAS backend**, three of these are not plumbing-only: `current_mode_update`, `config_option_update`, and `session_info_update` are consumed as display signals. KAS folds signals that kiro-cli sends as separate top-level `_kiro.dev/*` methods (agent switch, per-turn metadata, compaction status) into these `session/update` discriminants, so a KAS-gated branch in `AcpSessionHandle._handle_update` maps `current_mode_update` → agent-switch echo, `config_option_update` → effort-option state, and the `session_info_update` `_meta.kiro` union (`context_usage` → context meter, `turn_completion` → per-turn credits, `summarization_*` → compaction status). kiro-cli never emits these discriminants, so the branch is gated to KAS only and the kiro path is untouched.

**Context-window backfill.** kiro 2.10+ metadata may carry only a context-usage *percentage* (no absolute token counts). `_backfill_context_window(pct)` derives the window and used-token counts from the central `model_registry.model_window(self._resolved_model_id or self._model)` authority (gated on `has_known_window` so an unknown model is never backfilled with a guessed window) and the percentage, so the dashboard token text still renders when only a percentage arrives. `_resolved_model_id` begins as `models.currentModelId`, then becomes a successfully dispatched non-default startup override or explicit switch, whether it uses `session/set_model` or `session/set_config_option`; a policy-substitution advisory on the latter records the model actually served for that request only. Automatic and unusable routes retain the backend-reported default.

**Per-turn kiro billing credits.** `_track_metadata()` parses each `_kiro.dev/metadata` notification via the shared `parse_metadata()`, capturing `meteringUsage` entries with `unit=="credit"` (kiro bills in credits; token fields are 0 for the acp provider) into `AcpPromptStats.credits`, accumulated across the turn and surfaced on `EVENT_COMPLETE`.

**Per-turn cost and token counts (claude seam).** The `claude-agent-acp` adapter bills in cost/tokens instead of credits: a session-cumulative `cost: {amount, currency}` rides `usage_update`, and turn-scoped token counts (`inputTokens`/`outputTokens`/`cachedReadTokens`/`cachedWriteTokens`) ride the PromptResponse. Both are validated at the shared `_dispatch.py` chokepoints (`parse_usage_cost`, `parse_prompt_token_usage` — same defensive posture as `parse_usage_update`). `parse_usage_cost` additionally drops the whole cost when a `currency` is present and not exactly `"USD"`, since every consumer stores the result in USD-denominated fields; an absent currency stays accepted for adapters that omit it. Validated readings are folded into `AcpPromptStats`: the cumulative cost is converted to a per-turn delta by `apply_cost_cumulative` (monotonic guard — a reading below the stored baseline means the adapter's counter reset, so the new total is taken whole rather than emitting a negative delta; the baseline survives `carry_over()` like the context fields and is dropped by `reset_context_state()`), and the token counts accumulate via `apply_prompt_token_usage` (`_track_prompt_usage` on both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionHandle`). Every `EVENT_COMPLETE` construction site builds its `TurnUsage` through the single `AcpPromptStats.to_turn_usage()` helper, so `cost_usd` and the token dimensions populate uniformly and the per-turn persist gate fires on the claude seam. kiro-cli sends neither signal, so on the kiro path the new dimensions stay 0 and `credits` flows exactly as before (harness parity — no `_is_claude` branch anywhere on this wiring).

## Exceptions

The `AcpError` family is defined in `acp/transport_errors.py` and re-exported by
`acp/client.py`; each class keeps `kiro_crew.acp.client` as its `__module__`.

The full hierarchy, with each class's retry verdict, is in
[error-handling.md](../common/error-handling.md); the notes below cover the classes
whose transport behaviour this module owns.

- `AcpProcessDied` is raised by every stdin writer on `BrokenPipeError` / `ConnectionResetError`, and on a stalled write; see "`AcpProcessDied` on a stalled stdin write" below.
- `AcpAuthRequired` — kiro-cli is not authenticated (`kiro-cli login` needed). Non-retryable: `ensure_ready()` skips the retry ladder and re-raises so callers surface the actionable message rather than reset-and-requeue.
- A context-window overflow remains an ordinary `AcpError`. `_raise_acp_error`
  constructs it through the same path as other protocol failures, obtains the
  retry verdict from `_is_transient_raw_error`, then sets `transient=False`,
  `structural_terminal=True`, and `context_overflow=True` together in the
  data-field-only structural tag block. The JSON-RPC `message` field cannot set
  those tags, and same-session transient retry never receives this failure.
- `AcpPromptBusy` — a prompt is already in progress on the session, classified from kiro-cli's "already in progress" text via `_PROMPT_BUSY_RE` and raised at prompt-dispatch sites. `slack/handler.py` catches it and auto-resets the wedged session (`sessions.reset`) before recording the failure, so the next message cold-starts cleanly.

### `AcpProcessDied` on a stalled stdin write

| Constant | Value | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `_RESPONSE_WRITE_BOUND_SECS` | 5.0s | the no-progress window for a frame write or lock wait |
| `_RESPONSE_WRITE_MIN_PROGRESS_BYTES` | 4 KiB | the smallest drain per window that counts as progress |
| `_RESPONSE_WRITE_UNOBSERVABLE_BOUND_SECS` | 900s | the single fixed window under the proactor loop, where the level cannot be observed |

`AcpProcessDied` is raised by every stdin writer on `BrokenPipeError` / `ConnectionResetError`, and additionally by the **request-, response- and notification-frame** writers when `stdin.drain()` has not made progress within `_RESPONSE_WRITE_BOUND_SECS` (5.0s, sized like chat_runner's `_STEER_NOTICE_BOUND_SECS`): `AcpClient._send_response` / `_send_error` raise it directly, and the shared `AcpRuntime.send_response` / `send_error` (the default kiro backend, one stdin for every multiplexed session) mark the runtime dead and raise `AcpRuntimeDead`, which `AcpSessionProvider` translates to `AcpProcessDied`.

`drain()` returns at once while the pipe has room and parks only when the writer is flow-control paused — the pipe behind it is full — which is what a backend that stopped reading looks like, but also what a healthy backend looks like while it consumes another session's multi-MB prompt frame queued ahead of the response on the shared stdin.

The bound is therefore a **no-progress** bound (`await_under_no_progress_bound` / `write_response_frame_bounded`): it polls the transport's write-buffer level and only gives up when the level held still for the whole window; a level that moved is activity — a shrink is the reader consuming, a growth is a frame from a writer the lock woke ahead of this caller landing on the pipe — and is measured again from the new level, so a large frame never gets a healthy shared runtime marked dead.

A drop only counts when it is at least `_RESPONSE_WRITE_MIN_PROGRESS_BYTES` (4 KiB) per window, and that alone bounds the whole wait by construction: the level is finite and non-negative and every continued window removed at least the floor from it, so a backlog of B bytes is waited on for at most B/floor + 1 windows (plus the same for any sibling frame appended meanwhile). There is deliberately no flat ceiling — the largest frame is unbounded (any number of 5 MiB image blocks), so any fixed figure would either kill a live reader on a valid frame or be arbitrary. An awaitable found complete as a window closes counts as completed. A cancel notification (`cancel_session`, `send_notification`) waits for the lock under the same bound and is appended unlocked if the lock does not come, so the one cooperative signal that can end a wedged turn is never swallowed by the lock. The handle-owned deny sites in `session_handle.py` write their SEL audit before the (now bounded) reject write.

Under the proactor loop (`_is_proactor_loop`, keyed to the public `asyncio.ProactorEventLoop`; Windows's subprocess pipes report the whole in-flight overlapped write until it completes, so the level is flat while a live reader consumes a large frame) the wait falls back to the single platform-limited window `_RESPONSE_WRITE_UNOBSERVABLE_BOUND_SECS`, a fixed 900s (~30 MiB at ~40 KiB/s, the one place a fixed figure remains because there is no level to derive from; test-pinned) — the same declared degradation as the Windows watchdog.

That measurement is exact only with one writer in flight, so **every stdin write on a transport takes that transport's write lock** (`_stdin_write_lock`, on both `AcpClient` and `AcpRuntime`; request, notification, response and error frames alike), and the response write waits for the lock under the same no-progress bound — waiting for the lock is waiting for the previous frame's drain, and a lock held by a writer whose buffer no longer shrinks is the same stall. Nothing is appended behind a reader judged dead, and a runtime writer that queued for the lock re-checks `_dead` under it before writing, so a frame is never written into a runtime `_mark_dead` has already torn down. It cannot observe delivery of an accepted frame (the protocol gives no ack for a response); it bounds the wait on a paused writer whose reader consumes nothing, the same undeliverable-response condition a closed pipe reports, and routes it into the same session-reset + bounded-requeue recovery instead of pinning the deny path to the turn deadline. The premise that a healthy backend never leaves stdin unread for a whole window is the protocol's own: ACP is JSON-RPC over stdio, and every harness's stdin reader is the loop that delivers the permission response being written — a backend awaiting that response is, by construction, reading stdin; the window fires only when the level held perfectly still (nothing consumed), never on slow consumption. A transport that exposes no buffer size fails closed at the window.

The request id in the warning log and the exception text passes through `_loggable_request_id` (`repr`, the shared `redact_text` scrub over the whole text, then the display cap — redact-before-bound; an id over the input cap is replaced by a length-only marker, never truncated, so a severed secret can never reach the redactor), because the id is backend-authored; every `id=`/`req=`/`method=` log line under `acp/` (client, runtime, session handle, dispatch) uses the same helper for every frame-fed slot on the statement (ids, session ids, tool-call ids, methods), and `test_deny_bounded_write.py` scans for any unlisted one.

`_send_request` / `send_request` / `_send_and_await` (caller-sized payloads — a prompt may carry any number of 5 MiB image blocks) take the **same** no-progress bound under the lock (`write_request_frame_bounded`). A flow-control-paused kiro-cli — busy generating on one multiplexed lane and not reading stdin, as right after `spawn_run` fans several session prompts onto the one pipe — therefore cannot park a request write forever with the shared write lock held. The bound is on PROGRESS, not elapsed time, so a caller-sized frame stays legal. `write_request_frame_bounded` returns which phase stalled (`RequestWriteResult`) for the log; BOTH phases mark the transport dead and raise. The write path never signals the child: on the shared runtime that would bypass the ownership authorization (`authorize_runtime_kill`) and teardown barrier and terminate sibling sessions.

The runtime records the death as a stdin stall (`stdin_stall_death`), and ambiguity is a property of that stalled pipe: the stalling write's own `ambiguous_delivery` (a drain-phase stall left its frame buffered; a lock-phase stall wrote no byte) and, for every co-tenant, a prompt written in a turn that was running when the stall killed the runtime (`AcpSessionHandle.prompt_outstanding_on_stall`, read by `_died` and `AcpSessionProvider._translate_dead` from the runtime's `turn_active_at_stall` snapshot, so it holds after the turn's own teardown). A steer is ambiguous only on its own buffered frame (`AcpSessionProvider.steer` translates with `own_write_only`; codex `_steer_via_steering_request` re-raises a drain-phase stall instead of reporting the steer unwritten, and raises an ambiguous death when the runtime dies of a stdin stall before answering a written steering frame). A stdin-stall death is never re-typed as `AcpRegistrationRateLimited`, an ambiguous `AcpProcessDied` is never transient, and `taskq.dependency.classify_exception` never reads one as a dependency wait, so no retry ladder replays it verbatim. `build_recovery_requeue` takes the restored-state continuation (`_CONN_RECOVER_MSG`, which also says to check current state before repeating any step, since work may have taken effect without appearing in the conversation), the task executor sets the step's `resume_hint`, and a steer whose RPC died ambiguously is requeued by the turn's teardown with a note, on the model input only, that it may already have been delivered.

The owner kills the stalled child before a replacement starts, and starts none until the kill confirms it dead (otherwise the attempt fails and the next one retries the kill): the task-run runtime bootstrap reaps a dead runtime before spawning and, after a stdin-stall death, starts nothing while `stdin_reader_may_live()` (the root by identity, or any live member of its process group, where the pipe is inherited) still answers True, and the direct `AcpClient` marks itself stalled (neither responsive nor mid-turn) and kills its child in the next `ensure_ready`, which raises while that child is still running. What this guarantees is that the host never re-sends possibly-delivered work as fresh work; the child may still act on a frame it reads before that kill lands, which the continuation then inspects instead of repeating.

`cancel_session` / `send_notification` take the best-effort path described above (bounded lock wait, unlocked append fallback, bounded drain) for the notification itself, and no `drain()` or stdin `write()` under `acp/` lives outside `transport_framing.py` (`test_deny_bounded_write.py` pins it); the `cancelled` answers `cancel_session` then writes for open permission requests are response frames and take the response-write bound, and `_cancelled` is set before the write so the cancel-grace kill still ends the turn if even that fails.

## Process Management

Windows physical spawn uses `create_windows_cleanup_owned_process` in both ACP
transports. It reserves separate cleanup capacity before calling the subprocess
factory, pins the original child before resume, and retains only exact handles
and scalar bookkeeping outside the provider. Cancellation settles the factory
and the suspended-resume worker before teardown; a returned child cannot be
refunded as a failed empty launch. Cleanup retires mandatory tracking under the
root pin before returning capacity. Client reset refuses an unretired cleanup
reservation, even if the root has exited. The process-local limits, permanent
manual-overflow quarantine and operator recovery procedure are owned by
[platform-compat](../common/platform-compat.md#windows-session-tree-teardown).
The factory accepts `windows_cleanup_owner` from that reservation and records the
native handle at `CreateProcess` return, before fallible CPython transport setup.
An exception without a returned `Process` therefore still retains a created child.
Cancellation settles both creation and suspended-resume work before returning.
POSIX spawn/cancellation semantics and resource Job settings are unchanged.

The child-enumeration, identity and escaped-child helpers named below
(`_get_child_pids`, `_direct_children`, `_get_start_time`, `_read_basename`,
`_capture_child_records`, `_is_our_child`, `_kill_escaped_children`) and the
RSS-tree helpers live in `acp/runtime_process_tree.py`. Each facade re-exports
the names it defined: `acp/client.py` the child-enumeration, identity and
escaped-child helpers, `acp/runtime.py` the RSS-tree helpers (it also imports
`_get_child_pids` and `_capture_child_records`).

Subprocess lifecycle:

- Spawned with process-tree isolation for clean teardown, dispatched per-platform in the launch tail (`acp.launch.launch`): **POSIX** sets `start_new_session=True` (group leader via `setsid`) so cleanup can `killpg`; **Windows** sets `creationflags=platform_compat.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` (no `setsid`/process groups; an inherited Ctrl-C can't reach the gateway). Both flags are passed explicitly (never via `**dict` unpack, which breaks mypy's Popen overload resolution). Teardown in `_kill_process()` is dispatched per-platform too. **Windows** returns through the owned-handle drain described above and never reaches the signal ladder: `terminate_windows_asyncio_tree` tears the tree down from handles pinned at spawn, so a `taskkill /T` walk that a reaped root leaves empty is not what the teardown depends on. **POSIX** awaits `platform_compat.kill_process_tree_async(pid, SIGTERM)` then `SIGKILL` — `os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid), …)` inline and non-blocking. The Windows `taskkill /T /F` shim in `kill_process_tree_async` remains for callers that hold only a pid, offloaded to `kiro_crew.executors.subprocess_executor` so the event loop is never blocked for the `taskkill.exe` spawn. The escaped-child sweep (`_kill_escaped_children`, which raw-`os.kill`s descendants that reparented out of the killed group) is **POSIX-only** — a no-op on Windows, where the owned-handle drain has already confirmed each retained member's exit before `_kill_process` returns (the drain, not a `taskkill /T` walk, is what the Windows teardown depends on; that shim is only for callers holding a bare pid) and `signal.SIGKILL`/`os.kill(pid,0)` are unavailable/unsafe. The `/proc`+`pgrep`+`ps` child-enumeration helpers (`_direct_children`, `_get_start_time`, `_read_basename`) short-circuit on Windows (return `[]`/`None`) since they only feed that POSIX sweep. `_resolve_ssh_auth_sock()` (called in the spawn prelude) is also a no-op on Windows — its non-darwin branch calls `os.getuid()`, absent on win32, and Windows OpenSSH uses a named pipe with no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to repair.
- **Off-loop PID inspection**: the PID-recycling/ownership helpers that shell out on macOS — `_get_start_time` / `_read_basename` (`ps`), `_get_child_pids` → `_direct_children` (`pgrep`), the `_capture_child_records` batch wrapper, and the `_kill_escaped_children` sweep — MUST run via `run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)`, never directly on the event loop. The PID-file tracking writes — `_track_pid`, `_track_session_pid`, `_track_child_pids` in `AcpClient._spawn()`, and `_track_child_pids` plus the `_untrack_child_pids` prune in `AcpRuntime._snapshot_descendants()` / `_prune_dead_descendants()` (the latter reached through `asyncio.to_thread`) — carry the same obligation: each takes an exclusive file lock and does a read-modify-append under it, and `ensure_ready()` awaits `_spawn()` from the loop on every cold start, so an on-loop tracker serializes concurrent spawns behind one file lock with the waiter holding the loop. The subprocess spawn (fork/exec) can block, and on a wedged child the loop would freeze (the macOS wedge class). `subprocess_executor` is a *dedicated* bounded pool (distinct from the `maintenance_executor` orphan sweep) so a wedged scan/close cannot starve the recovery sweep. The `ps` and `pgrep` calls each carry a 2s timeout so no offloaded scan occupies a pool worker indefinitely.
- **Windows exe-casing normalization** (`_normalize_exe_casing`, applied to the kiro / claude-agent-acp / claude-code resolver results): `shutil.which` builds the resolved name's extension from `PATHEXT`, which lists `.EXE` upper-case, so it returns e.g. `…\kiro-cli.EXE` even though the on-disk file is `kiro-cli.exe`. A case-sensitive multiplexer shim spawned as `kiro-cli.EXE` fails to dispatch, exits instantly, and the ACP pipe breaks (`AcpProcessDied`) → the dashboard shows **"session stuck"** on the first chat turn. `os.path.realpath()` restores the true directory-entry casing. No-op on POSIX (case-sensitive FS). Runnability is checked via `platform_compat.is_executable_file()` (POSIX execute bit; on Windows the X-bit is meaningless so a known runnable extension is required instead), so a bare `.js` adapter entry is correctly treated as **not** directly runnable on Windows and gets wrapped with `node`.
- **Sandbox ownership**: the launch tail both drivers call (`acp.launch.launch`) calls `sandbox.wrap_argv()` to wrap the command with platform-native isolation (Linux: two-stage `unshare -rm` → `unshare -U` bind-mounts + UID drop; macOS: `sandbox-exec` Seatbelt profile). On Windows, where Kiro Crew has no native OS wrapper, an explicitly classified official Kiro backend delegates to Kiro CLI's built-in sandbox; every other backend retains the no-backend fail-closed policy. The parent passes a fully scrubbed child environment on every platform, which is the enforcement point for raw Windows delegation. Configurable via `sandbox_mode` constructor param (`"auto"` default, `"off"` to disable). See `docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`.
- **Parent-level channel-credential scrub**: both spawn paths (`AcpClient._spawn` and `AcpRuntime._spawn`) hand their plan to the one launch tail (`acp.launch.launch`), which builds the child environment from a raw `os.environ` copy (plus `_extra_env`) and passes it directly to `create_subprocess_exec`, so it calls `sandbox.scrub_agent_denied_env(env)` after merging `_extra_env` to strip `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` (Slack/WeCom/Telegram tokens + owner id seeded into `os.environ` by `config.loader.load_credentials`). This is required because these paths do NOT route through `sandboxed_spawn_argv`, and the OS-sandbox launcher only strips those keys for the `cc`/`strict` tiers — on the default `auto`/`standard` tier the launcher leaves them in place, so without the parent scrub they would be inherited by the agent subprocess. The scrub is deliberately narrower than `scrub_env`: it leaves the AWS/SSH env the `standard` sandbox intentionally exposes (git-over-SSH, AWS CLI, kubectl) untouched. One credential is settled per-backend rather than by the deny list: `KIRO_API_KEY` (kiro-cli's own model credential, in `CREDENTIAL_KEYS` but deliberately NOT in `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS`) is re-injected from the data home's `.env` via `config.loader.inject_kiro_cli_api_key` for a kiro-cli child (whose environment is where the CLI reads it — required after the Docker entrypoint scrubs it from the gateway's environ) and actively stripped via `strip_kiro_cli_api_key` for a foreign backend (Claude seam), which must never receive it. The KAS relay is a kiro-cli, so its answer follows the spawn plan's auth owner (`apply_spawn_env(..., cli_owned_auth=not plan.host_auth)`): a cli-owned relay (`--auth-method cli`) is handed the key like the kiro backend, because kiro-cli keeps no stored record of an API-key sign-in and the variable is the whole login; a Crew-owned relay has it stripped, because the engine prefers an environment key over the vault callback; both run inside the spawn paths' existing off-loop env hop.
- **Client application tag**: every kiro-cli ACP child on the kiro backend (the kiro harness's `apply_spawn_env` and `AcpClient._spawn`, both via `harness._common.apply_client_application_env`) gets `KIRO_CLI_CLIENT_APPLICATION=kirocrew` (`CLIENT_NAME`, the `clientInfo.name` value, is the same constant), overwriting any inherited value. kiro-cli puts it on the user-agent of every request to its model backend as `clientApp/kirocrew`, which is how a backend-side record identifies Crew traffic. `clientInfo.name` does not do this: kiro-cli keeps it in telemetry (`acp_client_name`) and in the `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV` of the tools it spawns, never on its own requests. The KAS harness does not set it: the v3 engine behind the KAS relay builds its own fixed user-agent, so the tag would reach no KAS model request until kiro-cli forwards it there. One-shot kiro-cli commands outside ACP (`/usage`, `whoami`, `--list-models`) run no model turn and are not tagged.
- **Operator env defaults for kiro-cli children** (`agent.child_env_defaults`, `acp/child_env_defaults.py::apply_child_env_defaults`): an operator mapping, empty by default, filled into the env of every kiro-cli child -- the kiro and KAS harnesses' `apply_spawn_env` (sessions, background sessions, subagents) and `AcpClient._spawn` when `_is_kiro` (inside the `kiro_api_key=True` branch of `_resolve_spawn_env`) -- for keys the inherited env (gateway env plus per-session overlay) does not already carry; a present value, even an empty one, wins. Foreign harnesses get nothing. It runs in the existing off-loop hop and before `scrub_agent_subprocess_env`, so a default cannot reintroduce a denied name. It accepts only an allowlist (`sections.CHILD_ENV_DEFAULT_NAMES`): `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` and `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`, each a decimal integer string in [1, 1024]; anything else is dropped with a warning at config load. The allowlist exists because each name is a measured kiro-cli pool knob, while any other variable would reach every process the agent runs. Intended use is capping kiro-cli's core-count-sized pools on many-core hosts. Trade-off: these are ordinary env vars, so every process the agent runs (MCP servers, tools, a user's own Tokio or rayon program) inherits them too and runs with the capped pools; that is why the default is empty. The mechanism also depends on kiro-cli continuing to honour the generic variables; a kiro-cli release that sets its pool sizes explicitly would silently ignore them. A process-scoped cap inside kiro-cli would replace this.
- `_resolve_kiro_bin()` delegates to the side-effect-free `kiro_cli.resolve_kiro_cli()` discovery module shared with first-run setup. It checks the explicit `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` operator/test override first, then the desktop app's bundled copy (`KIROCREW_BUNDLED_KIRO_DIR`, set by the Electron shell only when the payload shipped; the candidate there is `<dir>/kiro-cli-chat`, `kiro_cli.BUNDLED_KIRO_CLI_ENTRY`, because the `kiro-cli` launcher never resolves the chat binary beside itself), then the supported fixed install locations and augmented PATH; the bundled directory sits in the fixed part of the list, so `pin_kiro_cli` (the off-`PATH` pin every unattended spawn uses) resolves it too. Setup status may inspect the same candidates but never mutates the override or other process-global environment. The gateway's prerequisite service and the direct `chat`/`tui`/`run`/`consolidate`/`eval` CLI entry paths both register the override's canonical path and first-observed digest before any provider can be created; process-lifetime first-observation-wins semantics prevent a later service reconstruction from blessing replacement bytes. `runtime.py` imports and reuses the ACP wrapper so both ACP transports select the binary identically. Immediately before OS sandboxing, `sandbox.py` routes argv[0] through the edition-neutral `PlatformContext.agent_executable` resolver; the public Default is identity and a companion can return a direct executable behind an edition-managed launcher without changing the core. One core-side swap exists above that seam and only for the KAS backend: on the Crew-owned branch (Crew's vault holds the identity) the harness replaces a resolved `kiro-cli` with the `kiro-cli-chat` in the same directory when there is one (`kiro_cli.chat_sibling`), because the POSIX launcher checks its own sign-in before it execs the chat binary for `acp`, which is exactly the check a Crew-owned spawn on a signed-out kiro-cli cannot pass; the cli-owned branch keeps the launcher (see [kas-auth](kas-auth.md)).
- The dashboard `/api/models` one-shot subprocess validates completion before parsing stdout: nonzero exit (with a bounded, redacted stderr tail), empty stdout, malformed JSON, or a payload without a model list each returns HTTP 503 so the client retries. A subprocess failure is never misreported as `JSONDecodeError` or cached as a successful empty model list. Before the spawn, it uses `config.loader.inject_kiro_cli_api_key` off-loop just like the interactive Kiro ACP path, so a headless Docker gateway whose entrypoint moved `KIRO_API_KEY` out of the long-lived parent environment still authenticates this official fixed-argv `kiro-cli` read; the general child-environment scrub remains unchanged. The catalog is held in memory
only (not persisted, with bounded rows). One shared single-flight `--list-models`
fetch serves every request, under a 90 s ceiling
(`_LIST_MODELS_BACKGROUND_TIMEOUT_SECS`) that outlives the 10 s request wait
(`_LIST_MODELS_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SECS`, after which the request answers 503
`model list timed out`). A cached catalog is served at once and refreshed behind
the reply once it is older than 300 s (`_LIST_MODELS_CATALOG_TTL_SECS`).
- **One-shot `kiro-cli` calls are supervised.** `--list-models`, `whoami` and the
  `/usage` scrape spawn through `kiro_prerequisite.spawn_supervised_oneshot`: the
  process-group supervisor runs in `--reap-survivors` mode in its own session and
  ends whatever the call left in the group, such as a credential helper a launcher
  wrapper started. Where the supervisor is unavailable (Windows), the wrapper is
  not a trusted system binary, or the host cannot reap (no pidfd, e.g. macOS), the
  call runs unsupervised, noted once at INFO. The helper also defaults `creationflags` to
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (`platform_compat._SUBPROCESS_NO_WINDOW`, `0` off Windows) and keeps a
  caller's own flags, so a console-subsystem child of the console-less gateway opens no
  console window; `/api/models` re-polls `--list-models` every 8 s while degraded.
- **One-shot `kiro-cli` reads spawn at the CONFIGURED sandbox tier**, via `sandbox.configured_sandbox_mode()` (`agent.sandbox`, falling back to `"auto"` and warning when the config cannot be read — an unreadable config must not yield a looser tier). The affected sites are `/api/models` (`--list-models`), and in `handlers/sessions.py` the `whoami` identity fetch and the `/usage` text scrape. On Windows all three pass `is_kiro_cli=True`, so a default `"auto"` install delegates to Kiro's built-in sandbox exactly like interactive chat and needs no broad unsandboxed-exec opt-in. They also pass `scrub_agent_subprocess_env()` as the explicit child environment. The configured-tier seam still matters for an explicit `agent.sandbox="off"` and for platforms with a Crew backend: a one-shot read must not silently request a stricter posture than the same long-lived Kiro binary. Use `configured_sandbox_mode()` for a spawn of the same binary under the same posture as chat — **not** for spawns that deliberately pin their own tier (the prerequisite probes' `strict`, the credential-free registry clones). Governance still clamps the result up via `_clamp_sandbox_mode`, so a `sandbox.min_level` floor overrides it like any other caller-supplied mode.
  - **Accepted trade on the two `sessions.py` sites**, stated explicitly because it is a real (small) loosening on hosts that *do* have a backend: they follow the configured tier rather than a fixed `"standard"`, so on Linux with an explicitly configured `agent.sandbox="off"` they spawn with no Kiro Crew wrap and do not hide `_STANDARD_DIRS` (`.gnupg`, `.config/gcloud`, `.azure`, `.docker`, the auth-staging dir). This is deliberate and is the *same* posture the interactive chat spawn of that identical binary already runs under on that identical host — a one-shot `whoami` cannot need stricter confinement than the long-lived chat session, and the previous asymmetry was an accident of a hardcoded literal, not a designed boundary. Both spawns are fixed argv with no agent-influenced arguments, `kiro-cli`'s own internal sandbox is the layer `"off"` defers to, and an operator who wants the wrap back sets `agent.sandbox="auto"` — the shipped default — which then applies uniformly to chat *and* these reads instead of only to these reads. The narrowness matters: this loosening is reachable only on a host where the operator has *already* declared `"off"` and thereby accepted that posture for every chat turn, which is a far larger and longer-lived exposure than one `whoami`.
  - **All three wraps run OFF the event loop**, in `subprocess_executor()`, via one small per-site helper (`_wrap_list_models_argv`, `_wrap_argv_whoami`, `_wrap_argv_usage_scrape` → `_wrap_argv_at_configured_tier`). Two blocking reads are involved and both must land in the worker: `configured_sandbox_mode()` stats — and on a cache miss re-reads and revalidates — `config.json`, and non-delegated `wrap_argv` calls can cold-probe the backend with a synchronous `subprocess.run(..., timeout=5)`. The mode is therefore resolved *inside* the helper. Each helper passes **`is_kiro_cli=True` explicitly**: on Windows this positive classification is the security gate for Kiro's internal-sandbox delegation, and `_spawns_kiro_cli` basename inference is intentionally insufficient. Both ACP spawn paths already use the same capability-set classification; any new one-shot official-Kiro spawn must too. The helpers are deliberately *named* for the chokepoint they call because `test_spawn_audit.py` audits routed spawns structurally.
- A **genuine** sandbox refusal on `/api/models` remains possible when the spawn is not positively classified, requests extra path restrictions, cannot write its critical delegation audit, or is not the official Kiro backend. It is caught as `SandboxUnavailableError` **before** the generic `except`, and answers 503 with `code: "model_list_sandbox_unavailable"`. A normal fresh Windows install of the official Kiro CLI follows the positively classified delegation path instead.
- **Poll-driven spawn sites are readiness-gated.** `kiro-cli` auto-launches an
  interactive browser login for any subcommand run unauthenticated
  (`--no-interactive` does not suppress it; there is no opt-out env var). Every
  dashboard endpoint that shells out to `kiro-cli` on a timer therefore calls
  `reject_if_kiro_unverified()` BEFORE resolving or spawning the binary:
  `/api/models` (polled every 8s while the model list is degraded) and
  `/api/sessions/usage` (polled every 30s by the credit pill). Both return the
  shared `kiro_prerequisite_required` 503 — the same degraded response their
  timeout branches already produce — so the client contract is unchanged and
  only the subprocess is skipped. Without this gate a signed-out gateway opened
  a browser window every 8 seconds indefinitely. These are the **only** blocking
  readiness gates: ordinary sends are ungated, because a failing ACP attempt
  reports its own `AcpAuthRequired` (see the governance of latched readiness in
  `modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md`), whereas a timer-driven spawn has no turn to
  carry that error. These sites authorize on a **freshly verified** probe
  (`verified_ready`), never the bare latch — a stale `ready=True` would
  green-light exactly the signed-out spawn the gate exists to prevent. The
  freshness bound differs by site: `/api/models` keeps the tight 30s ceiling
  (`_VERIFY_MAX_AGE_SECS`) because it is polled while degraded and has no cooldown
  on its spawn while no catalog is cached, so a wide window would re-open the
  browser-login storm; `/api/sessions/usage` reads on a 5-minute
  `_POLL_GATE_MAX_AGE_SECS` because its spawn is already throttled to one fetch
  per `_USAGE_REFRESH_SECS` (600s), so the wide window cannot storm it and only
  spares the credit pill the inline probe. The widened worst case is one
  stale-`ready=True` usage spawn up to five minutes after an external logout,
  still caught sooner by the identity-change re-probe and by Refresh.
- **`AcpAuthRequired` is the authoritative logout signal.** Readiness is probed
  at gateway start and on explicit user action only, so a mid-session sign-out is
  discovered when the ACP attempt fails, not by a poll. `AcpRuntime`/`AcpClient`
  translate the stderr `not logged in` banner into the non-retryable
  `AcpAuthRequired`; the dashboard turn loop handles it ahead of the generic
  `AcpError` branch (it is a subclass), never re-queues it, surfaces the
  actionable `kiro-cli login` message in the transcript, and latches the
  prerequisite service to signed-out. That error card is the **only** sign-out
  signal the dashboard shows — there is no reauthentication banner and no paused
  session state (see `modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md` § "The dashboard does not
  guide the user to sign in").
- **The readiness `whoami` runs against the real home, like an ACP session.**
  `kiro_prerequisite._run_auth_command(..., isolate_home=False)` runs the
  resolved CLI against the real environment/home under the standard OS sandbox
  with only the Kiro Crew data home hidden, and executes a sandbox-visible
  private snapshot of the resolved bytes (keeping the resolved basename so a
  multiplexer still dispatches). A rewritten `HOME` breaks any CLI whose session
  or tool registry lives in the real home — a toolbox multiplexer cannot even
  resolve itself — so the isolated probe reported such CLIs signed-out even
  though a real session authenticates fine.
- **Sign-in is fully delegated to `kiro-cli`.** `kiro-cli login
  --use-device-flow` runs against the user's REAL home and writes its own
  credential store, exactly as it does from a terminal. Kiro Crew stages no
  credentials and copies none back — the staged-home publish path (and the
  "Kiro identity changed during sign-in" conflict two racing gateways could
  hit) is gone. The isolated credential-minimal home remains available for
  callers that opt into it, so a probe can never read the real `~/.aws` /
  `~/.ssh`; the operator-initiated login runs in the real home inside the same
  OS sandbox posture ACP already uses, with the Kiro Crew data home hidden.
- 10MB stdout buffer for large JSON-RPC lines
- stderr drained in background (`_drain_stderr`) to prevent pipe deadlock. Each line bumps `_last_activity` (liveness for `is_responsive`), is appended to the bounded 20-entry `_stderr_lines` diagnostic ring buffer, and is forwarded as a redacted `WARNING`. **Exception — suppression filter:** lines matching a marker in the module-level `_SUPPRESSED_STDERR_MARKERS` tuple (currently `thinking_tokens`) are dropped — no `WARNING`, not appended to the ring buffer — but **still** bump `_last_activity`. This handles the claude-agent-acp "Unexpected case: {...thinking_tokens...}" stderr noise. **Mechanism** (confirmed by reading the vendored adapter's `dist/acp-agent.js`): claude-code emits a `system` message with subtype `thinking_tokens`, but the adapter's `switch (message.subtype)` enumerates only ~18 known subtypes (`init`, `status`, `compact_boundary`, `memory_recall`, `api_retry`, …) and routes anything else to `default: unreachable(message)`, which writes `logger.error("Unexpected case: " + JSON.stringify(message))` to stderr — one line per token delta, measured at ~10 lines/sec during active thinking (one per 2–4 thinking tokens). The payload is only `estimated_tokens`/`_delta`/`uuid`/`session_id`, so dropping it loses no response content. This is a forward-compat gap in the vendored adapter, **not** new behavior in a specific claude-code build — the `thinking_tokens` event is present in both `2.1.165.357` and `2.1.168.358` (verified by string-matching both bundled `claude` binaries), so it predates the `.168` update that drew attention to it. The cleaner long-term fix is upstream (add a `thinking_tokens` case to the adapter or bump the vendored version); this filter is the version-agnostic stopgap that also absorbs the next unenumerated subtype's flood. (Note `thinking_tokens` is by far the dominant subtype hitting `unreachable` — ~14k occurrences vs. a handful of rare `permission_denied` across retained logs — which is why the marker tuple stays narrow rather than suppressing all "Unexpected case" lines.) Two concrete reasons to drop rather than downgrade the level: (1) **log hygiene** — `gateway.log` uses `RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB, backupCount=3)` (`cli.py`), so a sustained burst rolls genuine diagnostics out of the retained 8MB window; (2) **event-loop load** — the file handler is a plain *synchronous* handler and `_drain_stderr` runs on the gateway event loop, so each forwarded line costs a synchronous file write + two regex redaction passes on the same loop that streams responses (small per session, compounding across concurrent thinking sessions). Keeping liveness prevents the idle watchdog from killing an actively-thinking turn; skipping the ring buffer stops a burst from evicting the last real errors. A throttled `DEBUG` summary (≥ `_SUPPRESSED_STDERR_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` apart, plus a flush at EOF) keeps the suppression observable. Match substrings are kept narrow so a genuine error is never silently swallowed. This is a log-volume / event-loop-load reduction — **not** a fix for any turn-stall or "agent not responding" symptom (no such causal link was established).
- A failure path reads that ring only after a bounded settle of the drain (`settle_drain`, 0.5 s): the EOF branch of `_read_message`, the failure classifiers behind `AcpClient._settle_stderr` and `AcpRuntime.settle_stderr` (at startup, and the per-turn death check in `_prompt_loop`, where a stopped turn ends as the cancel rather than `AcpProcessDied`), and the shared runtime's failed-start cleanup. The settle absorbs the drain's own outcome — its timeout, its error, its cancellation by a teardown — but never a cancel of its caller, told apart by the caller's `cancelling()` count growing during the wait. A Stop, shutdown or outer deadline that lands there propagates: `ensure_ready` ends instead of spawning a second child on its retry arm, after running the cleanup and reset that arm had already decided on (`_classify_failed_start`, which logs a cleanup failure rather than letting it replace the cancel), and a shared runtime's startup site raises the cancel rather than a generic death. Two callers differ on purpose. The EOF branch waits unshielded, because its child has exited and a drain outliving the budget is held open only by a descendant, so later settles on the same failure would wait again. `_failed_start_cleanup` absorbs a cancel of its own task, as its tree scan does, so the kill still runs. Pinned by `test/test_acp_sandbox_init_classification.py` and `test/test_acp_provider.py`.

### Member MCP routing

Member clients and runtimes use the ordinary direct or pooled MCP transport
supported by their backend. The gateway captures canonical member/store routing
from authenticated session identity; `member_context` controls native instruction
deduplication. Memory V2 neither discards the shared broker overlay nor requires
a member-specific sandbox or direct-MCP capability.

KAS projects the gateway's validated `KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT` as `KIROCREW_PORT`
for native managed MCP servers because native children do not inherit the
gateway environment. The listener address comes from the gateway, not an editable
agent spec. Declared secrets and arbitrary environment values remain withheld,
and non-managed servers receive no gateway port.

An `env` value that is exactly `${NAME}` survives projection on every projected server
when the edition lists `NAME` through
`McpToolingProvider.kas_relayed_env_references()`; the public default lists none.
KAS resolves the reference from its own environment at spawn, so the wire carries
the name and never the value, and a launcher's per-process variable reaches an
MCP child that KAS starts with a minimal environment of its own. Any other
reference is withheld, because the KAS environment also holds credentials such as
the CLI's `KIRO_API_KEY`.

The provider factory selects `agent.member_acp_backend` for member-DM session
keys and the configured default backend otherwise. Ordinary backend governance,
selectability, member-capability checks and host sandbox rules remain independent
requirements; memory version adds no direct-MCP refusal.

### Cold-start admission and startup telemetry

The admission coordinator here and the session-start gate and collector below are
defined in `acp/runtime_start.py`; `AcpRuntime` drives them, and `acp/runtime.py`
re-exports every name.

Every `AcpRuntime.spawn()` enters one gateway-wide, event-loop-affine admission
coordinator before subprocess preparation and holds the permit through
`initialize`. It orders spawns by start priority; see § Session-start gate. The cap is
`agent.runtime_spawn_concurrency` (`restart=True`): `"auto"` by default, which
`cold_start_sizing` resolves to half the effective `session_start_concurrency`
width, at least 2 and at most 8, so 8 once that width reaches 16; an integer is
clamped to 1..32. `SessionManager.__init__` publishes it for the process
(`cold_start_sizing.configure_runtime_spawn_width`) from the cached host reading
only, so `auto` is the floor until that reading exists; the gateway's post-bind
sizing task reads the host in a worker thread and then republishes it
(`SessionManager.widen_cold_start_queues`). Every admission lookup grows the loop's
admission to the published width (an int compare, never a shrink), so a spawn that
ran before the manager published does not pin the loop at the floor. `spawn()`
takes no await before admission, so concurrent spawns queue in arrival order. A process that built no manager (an embedder's, a
test's) keeps `_COLD_START_MAX_CONCURRENT` (2). This is
the common backstop for interactive, authoring, background, shared, and unpooled
runtime callers, including callers that bypass `SessionManager` or a worker pool.
The coordinator is keyed by event loop because a waiter's future is created on
the running loop, so embedded/test loops never share one `PrioritySemaphore`; cancellation while queued or starting returns the permit,
and the existing spawn guard still kills a subprocess when initialization is
cancelled or fails. It uses only asyncio/threading primitives and has no POSIX-only
behavior. A spawn-level `OSError` gets exactly one retry after two seconds while
holding its permit: this bridges a Kiro CLI self-update that replaces its executable
in place without exceeding the cold-start cap. The post-exec shim retries its own
`execv` on `ENOENT`/`ETXTBSY` (six tries over two seconds), so the same replacement
window does not surface as an exec failure on the shim path, where the parent's
spawn has already succeeded and only exit 127 would be left to report it.
Authentication, protocol, and configuration errors are not retried.

Structured `acp_cold_start` logs distinguish queue wait and spawn, and include
bounded active/queued counts, outcome, duration, backend class, and coarse process
state. Structured `acp_startup_stage` logs distinguish `initialize`,
`session/new`, `session/load`, and `session/set_mode`; timeout records carry the
method and budget plus bounded stderr-line count. They never include prompts,
workflow source, credentials, session ids, request ids, or raw process ids.

`ensure_ready()` emits the `kirocrew.session.startup.duration` histogram (unit `ms`) timing the cold-start work — subprocess spawn + session init. The warm fast-path (an already-spawned, already-initialized session returns early) is intentionally **not** measured, since it does no startup work. The emit lives in a `finally` covering **every** exit path, with `outcome` recorded as one of `ready` / `auth_required` / `error` (defaulting to `error`, so any unexpected exception propagating through the `finally` is counted as a failure, never a false `ready`) and `spawned` (bool — whether this call actually forked a new process). `get_recorder` is **lazily imported** inside the `finally` to break the `config.loader → acp.types → acp.client → metrics.provider → config.loader` import cycle, and the entire emit is wrapped in `try/except` so a telemetry failure can never break session startup.

### Session-start gate and tracked start ownership (`SessionStartGate`, `StartCollector`)

Cold-start admission bounds runtime spawn + `initialize`. The **session-start
gate** bounds the other expensive start: `session/new` on an already-running
runtime, which blocks while the backend initializes the session's MCP servers.
`AcpRuntime.create_session` acquires the current loop's `SessionStartGate`
(`agent.session_start_concurrency`, default `auto`, FIFO within a start priority,
sized once per loop from config; `restart=True`; `auto` resolves once per process in
`kiro_crew/session_start_sizing.py` to `clamp(min(cpus // 4, available_GB // 3), 2, 16)`,
with cpus the affinity count capped by a cgroup v2 `cpu.max` quota and memory from the
`resource_status` probe; the gateway resolves it in a worker thread at boot and logs the
value in force with its inputs, and `kirocrew doctor` prints what `auto` picks for the
host at the time it runs; an explicit integer wins) BEFORE `session/new` goes on
the wire and releases it as soon as the answer arrives. The gate is a FIXED semaphore: the adaptive
loop is the gatewayd spawn gate plus the execution-cap controller, and two
adapting loops on one resource oscillate. It is one gate for every harness
(kiro-cli, KAS, a later Claude host), because every backend's session start
runs through `create_session` (harness-parity: no per-backend branch).

**The shared `_bg` runtime starts under its own gate.** Every `run_bg_oneliner`
(auto-titles, nav labels, folder icons, summaries, STT endpointing) opens a fresh
`session/new` on the one shared `_bg` runtime, which answers them serially.
`get_bg_session` passes `bg_runtime_start=True`, so those starts take a permit
from `bg_runtime_session_start_gate()`: a separate per-loop `SessionStartGate`
of one permit, ordered by start priority like the user gate. Priority alone
cannot keep them off a person's path: a title fires on the first send and reaches
the gate before the sender's own start has finished spawning, so in a burst the
titles take the user permits first and hold each one while they wait inside the
`_bg` process. Pinned by `test/test_bg_runtime_session_start_gate.py`.

**Start priority: a start a person is waiting on is served ahead of background
starts.** Three in-process queues bound a start, and all three are one primitive,
`kiro_crew.start_priority.PrioritySemaphore`: `SessionManager._start_sem` (cold
starts, held across the provider's own spawn and `session/new` waits), the
cold-start admission (`agent.runtime_spawn_concurrency` spawns) and this gate
(`agent.session_start_concurrency`, collector headroom unchanged). The rule is
owned by the `kiro_crew.start_priority` module docstring; this section lists who
applies it.

- **Everything is BACKGROUND unless its caller claims FOREGROUND.** Nothing is
  derived from a session key: automation runs on interactive keys too (an
  auto-nudge or monitor wake, a cron or sub-agent completion injection, an
  agent's `session_send` into a slot), so a key says where a turn lands, not who
  waits for it. `get_or_create`, `open_task_session`, `get_bg_session`,
  `get_subagent_runtime`, `AcpRuntime.spawn` and `create_session` all default to
  BACKGROUND; the session layer hands the resolved priority to the provider it
  starts (`LLMProvider.start_priority`), which passes it to both of its runtime
  queues, and a task run that falls back to the companion runtime hands it to
  that runtime's `spawn`.
- **The claimers.** The dashboard runner, for a turn a person sent
  (`_turn_start_priority`: user-origin provenance and `_crew_log_actor ==
  "user"`, not a restored queue entry — a typed turn, a Resume/Continue press,
  the runner's requeue of a person's failed turn, a typed follow-up in a cron
  tab). The eager respawn that turn arms takes its priority, and so does the
  poisoned-conversation canary inside it. An eager spawn from the dashboard
  owner's own slot create, agent switch or project switch; the focus resume
  prefetch, a reload and any app-token request stay BACKGROUND. Every messaging
  channel, for a message a person sent: each transport's `receive` sets
  `person_origin` on the inbound it dispatches, a message the gateway built
  itself (a nudge or monitor wake, built by `build_inbound`) does not, and the
  dispatchers pass `person_priority(inbound.person_origin)`; a dispatcher that
  REBUILDS an inbound for a person (a button press, a slash command) carries the
  flag over, and a drained replay takes the flag its queued entries recorded at
  enqueue time (messaging.md § `InboundMessage`), because a gateway wake can be
  queued too. Slack's event and interaction
  paths pass FOREGROUND unless a trusted bot posted. The CLI chat. **Every
  dashboard claimer reads WHO ASKED**
  (`dashboard/request_priority.owner_start_priority`, which reads
  `is_owner_dashboard_request`): the composer optimizer, Side Chat, crewmate
  reply threads, Task Runner Refine and Plan, workflow authoring, Issue Radar's
  AI routes (`_run_oneshot_model`), and the eager spawn a slot action arms. An
  app token on its own slot is BACKGROUND there, because the person-only
  reserve is the one resource an app must not take from a person. STT
  endpointing, and the poisoned-conversation canary inside a person's turn,
  claim it through `run_bg_oneliner` -> `get_bg_session`, which passes it to its
  own `session/new` on the shared `_bg` runtime, to that runtime's (re)spawn
  admission when this call is the one that respawns it, and to the
  provider-backed entry's cold start on a backend with no shared runtime. A
  respawn runs under `_bg_runtime_lock` at the priority of the caller holding
  the lock (see the residuals below).
  Meeting translation is a per-line stream nobody waits on, so it claims nothing
  and takes the BACKGROUND default; so does STT polish, which the browser does
  not wait for.
- **Ordering.** FIFO within a priority, FOREGROUND first; a BACKGROUND waiter is
  passed by at most `_FOREGROUND_BYPASS_LIMIT` later FOREGROUND grants before it
  is served. Strict priority plus a named bypass, not weighted round-robin,
  because a person waiting must win outright whenever the bypass allows.
- **The outer reserve.** Ordering alone cannot help a person when every
  `_start_sem` permit belongs to a background start stuck behind a fan-out at an
  inner queue, so `_start_sem` carries `FOREGROUND_COLD_START_RESERVE` permits on
  top of the `agent.cold_start_concurrency` background width that only a FOREGROUND start may hold
  (`session_allocation.new_cold_start_semaphore`, which owns the rationale).
  Background keeps its full width; the first concurrent person start always gets
  an outer permit at once and then goes ahead at the inner queues; further
  concurrent person starts are served ahead of background ones as permits free.
  The inner queues keep no reserve: at their width it would halve background and
  collide with `_COLLECTOR_PERMIT_HEADROOM`.
- **The identity-sweep barrier** takes every `_start_sem` permit through
  `PrioritySemaphore.drain()`, which outranks both priorities while it waits and
  ignores the reserve, and hands back what it holds even when cancelled.
- **The guarantee, precisely.** At each in-process queue a person's start waits
  only for the permits held there and for at most `_FOREGROUND_BYPASS_LIMIT`
  background grants per queued background start. One exception: while the
  identity sweep runs (after an account change, after an incomplete sweep, or
  on every turn while the identity store cannot be fingerprinted), the person's
  turn waits at the drain for every holder, background ones included. A fourth
  queue is not covered yet: with `mcp_gateway.stub_servers` configured, a stub's
  `ensure_backend` waits in gatewayd's daemon-wide FIFO `SpawnGate` (#15830).
  A warm-pool refill (`session.pool_size > 0`) waits for its BACKGROUND permit
  with `_pool_fill_lock` released (#15857), so that lock's other waiters are not
  held behind foreground load. Known residual: `get_bg_session`
  (re)spawns the shared `_bg` runtime while holding `_bg_runtime_lock`, at the
  lock holder's priority: a FOREGROUND caller that arrives while a BACKGROUND
  caller's respawn is queued at the spawn admission waits on the lock for that
  whole background spawn, and its priority reaches only its own `session/new`.
  This needs the `_bg` runtime to be respawning (it died, or was recycled for
  age or RSS) at the moment a person's call arrives.
- **Clocks and telemetry.** A subagent's startup clock PAUSES while it is queued:
  the dedicated path at all three queues, the shared path at this gate and, when
  it needs a companion runtime, at that runtime's per-parent lock
  (`START_QUEUE_COMPANION`) and its spawn's admission, never across the spawn's
  own work. The
  callbacks receive the queue's name, and each wait accumulates into
  `_start_queue_wait_ms` -- measured on the WATCHDOG's own clock, between the
  mark and the grant, not on the queue's monotonic reading, which stops while a
  laptop is suspended and would charge that sleep as start time. The watchdog
  measures `_exec_started` minus that total, and a re-stamped `_exec_started` (a
  recovery respawn, a late adoption) clears it: the new attempt did not pay the
  old one's waits. Because one clock spans the spawn handshake,
  `session/new` and the collector wait, `_startup_deadline` includes the
  `initialize` budget as well, once per handshake round of a retried start
  (subagent.md § startup deadline). A paused total
  past `_START_QUEUE_MAX_SECS` ends the run as "Never started: start queues
  saturated". Connection warm-up's 90 s `wait_for(spawn())` includes queue time;
  a timed-out warm-up degrades to a cold first use, so it is left as is.
  `run_bg_oneliner`'s `timeout` bounds the DRIVE only: cancelling its
  acquisition would kill the shared `_bg` (re)spawn that every later caller
  reuses, and leak a backend session whose `session/new` had already gone out.
  `acp_cold_start stage=queue_wait`, the collector line and
  `session_cold_start stage=queue_wait` (logged only above
  `START_QUEUE_LOG_MIN_MS`) carry the priority and `PrioritySemaphore.describe()`
  (per-class depth and bypass count).

Pinned by `test/test_start_priority.py` and
`test_session_start_gate.py::test_a_chat_start_acquires_the_gate_ahead_of_queued_child_starts`.

`on_gate_queued(queue)` fires before the wait and
`on_gate_acquired(queue_wait_ms, queue)` at gate EXIT, both naming which queue
fired them, so a caller can PAUSE its own clock for exactly the span spent
queued: queue time never counts against the session-start budget
(`agent.session_start_timeout_secs`, 90s floor) or the subagent startup
watchdog, which accumulates the pauses rather than restarting its clock (see
§ Start priority, and subagent.md § startup deadline). Structured
`acp_startup_stage ... outcome=collecting` logs carry the gate's active/queued
counts and its per-class depth.

**Timeout never abandons the request.** On `session/new` timeout
`_send_and_await` does NOT pop the request: it re-registers a fresh future
under the same id and marks it adopted (`_pending_requests.adopt(req_id)`; the
map is a `_PendingRequests` dict that records adopted ids and drops them on
`pop`/`clear`). `create_session` hands that future and the gate permit to a
detached `StartCollector` and raises `AcpSessionStartTimeout(collector=...)` (a
subclass of `AcpRequestTimeout`; `collector` is None when the request never
reached the wire, in which case the permit is released on the spot). The
collector waits up to `agent.start_collect_timeout_secs` (300s) and settles
exactly one way:

| Late event | Outcome | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| answer + `late_adopter` returned True | `adopted` | the session is finished through the same tail as a direct start (`_finish_create_session`: queue, handle, mode activation, drain) and handed to the adopter, seeded with the init frames staged under its own session id |
| answer, no adopter or adopter declined/raised | `torn_down` | `_teardown_late_session` → per-session `terminate_session`; the shared runtime is never killed |
| runtime died | `runtime_dead` | nothing to tear down |
| cleanup deadline | `abandoned` | request id dropped from `_pending_requests` |

The last two rows are ORDER-INDEPENDENT, and that is a requirement rather than an
observation. `_mark_dead` resolves the collector's future with `AcpRuntimeDead`, so
"runtime died" is reached only when that resolution wins the race against the
collector's own timeout — and on a slow host it loses, which would report the one
outcome an operator can act on ("the process is gone") as the one they cannot ("it
never answered"). The timeout arm therefore reads the runtime's `_dead` flag, which
is not a clock, and settles `runtime_dead` when the runtime is already gone whatever
fired first. Measured: this read as `abandoned` on a Windows shard while every Linux
run said `runtime_dead`. Both orders are pinned —
`test_session_start_gate.py::test_runtime_death_settles_collector_without_teardown`
has the death win, `::test_a_death_the_collector_timeout_beat_is_still_runtime_dead`
has the timeout win with the future deliberately left unresolved, so the flag is the
only route to the right answer.

**Init-frame staging follows the ownership.** While a collector owns a start, the
reader keeps staging that start's MCP-init frames — on the collector
(`stage_init_frame`), and `_collect_late_start` seeds it with whatever the
timed-out attempt had already staged. An adoption claims the frames naming its own
session id (`take_init_frames`) and seeds the handle's queue with them, so a
late-adopted session arms `drain_init()`'s idle shortcut instead of paying the
no-report ceiling and its `mcp_session_report()` is populated. Those frames are
registration EVIDENCE: a session missing them was never proof that its servers
were absent (see `mcp_session_report`), so what the earlier drop cost was the
report and the ceiling, not the tools. Every other outcome drops the frames in the
same `finally` that releases the permit. Two holders rather than one because
`_mcp_init_progress` reads the in-flight buffer un-keyed, **by server name**: a
collector-owned attempt's frames left there would be read as the NEXT
session-start timeout's progress and hide the servers that never reported for it.
Both holders are bounded (`_INIT_NOTIFICATION_BUFFER_LIMIT`) and claim by the
session id inside the frame, so no frame can reach two sessions.

**What the progress suffix counts, and says it counts.** The roster
`_mcp_init_progress` (and the dedicated client's `_mcp_timeout_progress`) reports
against is the `mcpServers` array the session put ON THE WIRE — on kiro-cli the
broker stubs Kiro Crew injects (`pooled_session_servers`), never the agent spec's
own servers, which the backend starts itself and which are not in the roster; and
nothing after MCP init inside the backend's session start is observable from the
runtime at all. A suffix of the bare shape `4/4 MCP server(s) reported` was
therefore read as "all MCP is up, so MCP is the problem", and a field report of a
90 s `session/new` was triaged as an MCP failure on the strength of that suffix
alone. The count is labelled `N/M session-injected MCP server(s) reported`
(the fraction itself is the bare count, so a grep on it works), a partial roster still lists `no report from …`, and a COMPLETE roster is
followed by `types.MCP_ROSTER_COMPLETE_NOTE` — "the stall is later in session
startup, not in those servers" (the fraction already says every server reported,
so the note carries only the conclusion; what the count does not cover is
documented here, not in the error line). The note is withheld when a roster
member reported an init FAILURE: that member counts as reported, so it is not
chased as silent, but it is named under `failed:` and the stall may be in it.
One string for both start paths so the two messages cannot drift. With NO roster (an empty `mcpServers` array) the reports can only
belong to the agent spec's own servers or a concurrent start, so that branch
says `N MCP server report(s), roster unknown` and does not claim them as
session-injected. The `failed:` and `awaiting authorization:` buckets are
unchanged: an out-of-roster server is still named there, where naming it is the
point. Pinned by
`test_session_start_timeout_diagnostics.py::test_a_complete_roster_says_the_stall_is_not_in_those_servers`.

**A start that queued behind another one says so.** kiro-cli (2.26 and earlier)
answers `session/new`, `session/load` and `session/set_mode` one at a time per
process. Its ACP handlers await the whole start, or the mode switch's MCP init,
inside the connection's dispatch loop, and that loop reads nothing else
meanwhile. A start sent while one of those is unanswered therefore spends its own
budget waiting for it. The commonest case is a retry sent behind the start that
just timed out, which its collector still owns.

On a backend in `ACP_BACKENDS_SERIAL_SESSION_STARTS` (kiro-cli, the one measured;
harness-parity H6), `_send_and_await` records the method and send time of every
awaited request in `_ONE_AT_A_TIME_METHODS` (`_one_at_a_time_sent`). Any other
backend records nothing and its timeouts read as before. An id counts only while
`_pending_requests` still holds it, so an answered or abandoned request drops out
at the next send and the map cannot outgrow the pending set.

When a session start times out, it carries only the requests ahead of it that
were STILL unanswered at its deadline (`queued_behind`). On a serializing backend,
this start had not begun while such a request was outstanding. A request answered
before the deadline may have cost a few seconds or nothing, so it is not blamed
for the budget. The same rule covers a request answered while this start was
still waiting for the stdin write lock. `_session_start_stalled` then puts `queued behind N earlier
request(s) this agent process had not answered by the deadline (…; oldest sent
Xs earlier), and it answers those one at a time` ahead of the MCP progress. The
roster-complete note is withheld in that case, because the budget went to those
requests, which is not "later in session startup". Pinned by
`test_session_start_queued_behind.py`.

**One permit is reserved for a start that has not gone out.** A collector holding
its permit is the intended back-pressure — the backend really is still working on
that request — but at `session_start_concurrency = 2` two collectors hold the
WHOLE gate for up to 300 s, and every `session/new` gateway-wide then queues
behind requests whose callers already gave up. The failures those queued starts
produce time out too and create more collectors, so the gate self-locks.
Measured on an operator host: one member slot spent 15 consecutive auto-nudge
cycles on `session/new timed out after 90s (0/10 MCP server(s) reported)` while
no new agent process was ever spawned — every attempt was in this queue.

So the hand-off is now conditional. `StartPermit.hold_for_collector()` claims one
of at most `limit - _COLLECTOR_PERMIT_HEADROOM` (1) collector holds
(`SessionStartGate.collector_holds`, ceiling `collector_hold_ceiling`); denied,
`_collect_late_start` releases the permit itself, logs
`outcome=gate_permit_returned` with the counts, and gives the collector `None`.
A collector without a permit is unchanged in every other respect: it still owns
the request id and still adopts or tears down the late session. At `limit == 1`
the ceiling is 0, which is the only reading of "always keep one free" a
single-permit gate admits. A refusal is logged with both counts rather than tallied: the log line is what an operator reads when a start queues, and a counter no runtime reader consults is dead weight.

Every path releases the permit exactly once (`StartPermit.release()` is
idempotent; `SessionStartGate.releases` counts real releases, and a release
returns the collector hold so the ceiling recovers) and unregisters
the collector (`AcpRuntime.start_collectors()` lists live ones). A caller
never re-issues `session/new` for the same attempt while a collector owns it,
and never starts a dedicated process in its place: congestion is answered by
waiting for the collector's verdict (subagent.md § Session sharing).

Pinned by `test/test_session_start_gate.py`: gate before `session/new` with
limit 2 across three starts; queue wait reported at exit; adopt / teardown /
decline / abandon / runtime-dead on both kiro and KAS harnesses; permit
released exactly once on every path; no collector for a pre-wire timeout; an
adopted session receives the init frames staged both before and during the
collector window and none of them is counted as a dropped frame; a settled
collector (torn down, abandoned or runtime-dead) keeps none and the next start's
timeout names its own silent servers; two live collectors never claim each
other's frames; `run.py` never calls `get_or_create` on congestion and continues
on an adopted late session.

**Adaptive-controller sample.** Every `session/new` outcome is one `AdaptiveController.record_start(duration_ms, ok, attributable_timeout, key="acp:session/new")` when a controller is registered (`adaptive.controller.current()`; a no-op otherwise): duration is measured from gate EXIT (the queue wait is admission's cost), `ok=True` on an answer, `ok=False, attributable_timeout=True` on `AcpRequestTimeout` (the congestion signal the controller's decrease keys on), `ok=False` on any other failure. `test_runloop_integration.py` pins the three shapes.

### Tool audit for non-chat clients (`AcpClient(audit_source=…)`)

The `audit_source` constructor param of `AcpClient` (default `None`) tags a client that runs tools **outside** the chat_runner / SubagentManager audit loop — the knowledge `llm_pool` worker-pool client, whose tool calls would otherwise never reach the security audit log. When set, `_maybe_audit_tool_call()` emits a per-tool-call SEL `tool_invocation` record; when `None` (chat / subagent clients) it is a no-op so those paths never double-log. The `sel().log_tool_invocation` call is offloaded onto `subprocess_executor()` (so SEL-backend I/O can never block the event loop) and bounded by `asyncio.wait_for(..., _SEL_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5.0)`; a timeout or any SEL failure is swallowed (logged at `WARNING`) so tool dispatch always proceeds. **Note:** Code Review Sage's `ReviewPool` runs on the shared `AcpRuntime` path (see "Additional consumers" below) rather than as an `audit_source` client. The runtime layer has no `audit_source`, so the pool emits the same per-tool SEL `tool_invocation` audit itself from `sage_lib/review_pool.py`, which is what keeps audit parity.

## Image Support

`_send_prompt()` auto-detects image file paths in messages (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`) via regex. When a valid image path is found:

1. Reads the file (paths over `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` = 10 MB stay as text, not inlined)
2. Identifies the raster type from its leading bytes; unsupported or truncated content stays as a path
3. Downscales so the longest edge is <= `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (2000 px), preserving aspect ratio and re-encoding according to the decoded format (an oversized GIF becomes a PNG still frame)
4. Shrinks further while the base64 payload still exceeds `MAX_IMAGE_B64_BYTES` (5 MiB), stopping at `MIN_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (256 px)
5. Base64-encodes the (possibly downscaled) bytes
6. Appends an image content block with the content-derived `mimeType`
7. Replaces the path in the text with `[image: filename.png]`
8. Sends both text and image blocks in the `prompt` array

**One prompt's own rules** (`build_prompt_blocks`). The marker lands only where the path grammar matched: a URL's own path or a longer path that merely contains the same characters is left alone (one pass over the grammar's match spans, never a whole-text replace), while a local path quoted as a URL query value (`?src=/tmp/a.png`) is a path to the grammar and is rewritten like any other; and the shared path grammar refuses a name that merely begins with a picture's path (`/var/a.png.backup`, `/var/a.png~`, `/var/a.png/other`), so neither this builder nor the replay scrubber treats it as a picture -- nothing is read, rewritten or scrubbed for it; a period followed by a capital letter is sentence punctuation (`/var/a.png.Then`), so the path ends there and the picture is attached. A second distinct file with the same basename in one message gets `[image: filename.png (2)]`, and so on, so every block's marker is unique within the prompt. The same bytes under two names are one block, marked at both places with the first name: the digest of the file's bytes is compared before any cap is consulted, so a duplicate of an attached picture past the cap maps to that picture's block instead of being dropped. A `[image: ...]` or `[image not attached: ...]` token the user typed, in any case, is escaped with a backslash, so only a marker this builder wrote reads as an attachment; the replay scrubber's own `[image not carried into this context]` is left as it is. A kept-out picture written as a markdown image (`![alt](path)`, `![alt](<path>)` or `![alt](path "title")`) gets its note after the closing parenthesis, so the link stays intact. A typed marker is escaped even when the agent takes no images, since the text still reaches the model. One prompt inlines at most `MAX_PROMPT_IMAGE_BLOCKS` (20) images and `MAX_PROMPT_IMAGE_B64_BYTES` (12 MiB) of base64; a picture past either cap stays a path in the text, followed by `[image not attached: prompt image limit]`, exactly as one over the per-image cap (or one that cannot be rendered within the size caps) is followed by `[image not attached: image size limit]`, so neither the user nor the model takes a dropped picture as seen (the notes speak about images, so only bytes that sniff as a raster earn one -- a text file named like a picture stays plain text, and so does an oversize picture reached through a hardlink, which the bounded sniff refuses to read); each is logged, the pictures past the block cap tallied into one line, and a picture past the block cap is read only to tell a duplicate from a new one, never decoded. The byte cap is half of the images' share (three quarters) of the smallest backend request-body ceiling measured so far -- 32 MiB, bracketed by a replayed request of 30.4 MB of base64 that was accepted and one of 33.8 MB that was refused as improperly formed; the count is where the backend's many-image dimension rule begins, and each replayed image costs about 1,600 tokens on every later turn. Both caps bound one prompt alone; what the conversation's replayed history carries in total is not measured here. Nothing here remembers earlier prompts: what a conversation's replayed history may carry in total is the backend's contract, not this builder's.

Within a path run delimited by whitespace or punctuation -- ASCII punctuation
outside a path, Unicode punctuation such as a dash or a bullet, the arrow blocks,
CJK/fullwidth punctuation, and for the replay scrubber a code span -- the shared grammar takes the
last supported image suffix: `/var/a.png版本/final.jpg` and `/var/a.png.jpg` each
name one picture. Whitespace, commas, parentheses and the other delimiters stop that
lookahead, so pictures separated by any of them remain separate
(`/tmp/a.png—/tmp/b.png` inlines two pictures, as a comma between them would), and
CJK prose without a later suffix can still follow a path. A path begins only at
the start of the text or after a delimiter, except a colon, which reads as a URL
scheme's (`/a.png:/b.png` names the first picture only). Two paths glued by letters
with nothing between them (`/tmp/a.png和/tmp/b.png`, and on Windows
`C:/x/a.png和C:/y/b.png` -- the second path's drive colon does not split the token,
though only a drive letter glued to the token continues it: after whitespace a
drive begins its own path, and a URL scheme's colon ends the token, so
`C:\me\report.md and https://example.com/logo.png` names no picture, the URL
stays as written, and `C:\docs\readme.txt and D:\tmp\shot.png` names exactly
the picture)
read as one token, so the
builder inlines nothing for them and the replay scrubber replaces them with one
marker; two paths glued by a symbol (an emoji, or on POSIX a backslash, which is
not a path character there) start no path at all, so the builder inlines nothing
and the replay scrubber leaves the text as written -- never the second picture
alone with the first dropped silently. On Windows a backslash is a path
character, so a backslash-glued pair is one path like the letter-glued one. A later
separator in that run makes the earlier suffix a directory
component, so non-image descendants stay text; without a later separator or image
suffix, non-ASCII text glued to the suffix is read as prose even if it could be a
directory name mentioned alone. The path body and every guard scan inspect at
most 512 characters (a UNC share's host segment too), so a path longer than that
stays text: space is legal inside a path, so an unbounded body would re-walk a
message of spaced fragments from every start before the tail guard refused it.

This leverages kiro-cli's `promptCapabilities.image: true` capability. The LLM receives the image inline — no tool call needed.

**Text-only turns.** Every prompt entry point (`LLMProvider.stream`, the handle's `prompt`, the direct client's `stream_events`) takes a keyword-only `allow_image` (default `True`) and forwards it down to `build_prompt_blocks`. `False` builds the blocks with `allow_image=False`, whatever the agent advertises: no path in the message is read or inlined, and it stays in the text. `llm_helpers.stream_and_collect` (and `stream_and_collect_json`) forward the same keyword to every attempt. `run_bg_oneliner` sends every background one-liner this way, and the history consolidator every turn it sends, because its prompt is text about a session and any path in it is quoted history (see the history-scrub section of [session](session.md)). The default call shape is unchanged for every other caller.

The suffix selects only which paths are candidates. `messaging.raster.sniff_raster_mime` derives the wire media type from the file content, and Pillow verifies the complete container when available. A real image with a misleading name is still inlined with truthful metadata; non-raster, unsupported, or truncated content fails closed and remains a path that a tool-capable agent can inspect.

**Dimension backstop** (`build_prompt_blocks` in `acp/prompt_blocks.py`). This shared builder is the single funnel every channel's images cross before reaching kiro-cli, so the `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (2000 px) downscale runs for all of them — dashboard upload/paste/screenshot, Slack, Discord. Anthropic rejects the ENTIRE request when a many-image conversation (>20 images) carries any image over 2000 px on a side; because kiro-cli replays the full message history every turn, one oversized image would otherwise sit at a fixed history index and wedge the session permanently (a follow-up resize cannot evict the original). The browser's client-side resize (1568 px, `website/src/utils/resizeImage.ts`) is a token-cost optimization on top; this server-side cap is the correctness guarantee that still holds when that resize is skipped or bypassed (e.g. the native `/api/screenshot` capture, or non-dashboard channels).

**Encoded-size backstop** (`_fit_encoded_budget` in `kiro_crew/imaging.py`). The dimension cap alone does not bound the payload: a raster can sit well inside 2000 px and still encode past the backend's per-image byte ceiling. `MAX_IMAGE_B64_BYTES` is **5 MiB, read out of the backend's own rejection** rather than derived from which provider kiro-cli routes through (which we treat as opaque) — the error names the limit in bytes, `image exceeds 5 MB maximum: 6714372 bytes > 5242880`, and 5242880 is exactly 5 × 1024 × 1024. Anthropic's published per-image ceiling for Bedrock and Google Cloud agrees, which is corroboration rather than the basis. The check must run on the ENCODED payload AFTER any downscale: `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` measures the file before the re-encode and cannot see base64's 4/3 inflation, so a ~3.9 MiB raster passes every pre-encode gate and is still rejected on the wire. Because a rejected image is replayed from a fixed history index on every later turn, this has the same wedge-the-session consequence as the dimension case. Erring low merely ships a smaller image while erring high ships a refused payload, so the cap is set to the observed value and callers can override it via `max_image_b64_bytes` if a backend ever reports a different number. `_fit_encoded_budget` applies the dimension cap, then keeps shrinking (0.8 per pass, up to 6 passes, from the rendition's OWN long edge so an already-in-cap image still makes progress) until the encoding fits. If nothing fits above `MIN_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (256 px) it fails CLOSED — the path stays in the text and no image block is emitted, because inlining a payload the backend refuses is strictly worse than sending a reference a tool-capable agent can open.

**Reusable entry point** (`downscale_image_block` in `kiro_crew/imaging.py`). The budget constants and Pillow machinery live in that LEAF module — `prompt_blocks` re-exports them — because the second consumer is the MCP gateway's tool-result rewrite (`mcp_gateway/image_budget.py`), which runs inside the gateway daemon and must not import the ACP package (doing so pulls the whole ACP client into the broker and closes an import cycle back into `mcp_gateway`). That rewrite holds every image content block in a brokered `tools/call` response to this same budget before the response reaches kiro-cli's conversation history — the tool-result counterpart of the prompt-path backstops above (see `docs/architecture/design-notes/mcp-gateway-oversize-response.md`, Layer 3). Images produced by kiro-cli's own built-in tools never transit Kiro Crew and must be capped upstream in kiro-cli.


### Outbound-request structure diagnostics (content-free)

`summarize_prompt_structure(blocks)` in `acp/prompt_blocks.py` returns a **purely structural** summary of the outbound `session/prompt` block list — total block count, a count per block `type` (`text` / `image` / `tool_use` / `tool_result` / `other`), the number of empty (blank/whitespace-only) text blocks, the `tool_use` vs `tool_result` counts (so a pairing imbalance is visible), and `total_bytes` (the serialized `json.dumps` size, or `-1` if the content will not serialize). `AcpSessionHandle.prompt` logs this summary once per turn build at **DEBUG** (the level this module reserves for per-turn diagnostics), tagged with the `sessionId`.

The summary carries **no message content** — only counts, types, and sizes — which is a hard requirement (issue #6022): the kiro-cli data dir is fenced precisely because it holds SSO tokens, so the diagnostics must never record block text, image bytes, or tool arguments. This lets an operator tell a stale/invalid model id apart from a structurally malformed payload the next time a turn is rejected as `Improperly formed request` (see the `_RE_MALFORMED_REQUEST` classifier), without ever exposing what the turn contained. The helper is defensive by contract: it never raises into the live prompt path (a malformed block list yields a partial/minimal summary), so a diagnostics failure can never break a turn.

### Turn-boundary loss diagnostics (content-free)

Two places in `AcpSessionHandle.prompt` could destroy or omit a turn's evidence
silently. Both now report, and both report **only** a count or the bare fact —
never frame text, tool arguments, tool results, or frame SIZE, since a size leaks
response length.

- **Pre-turn stale drain.** The drain empties the session queue of frames left by
  an abandoned turn (see the cancel-unacked / stale / tool-stall / timeout paths,
  which synthesize a terminal and return while the real kiro-cli turn keeps
  emitting). Permission REQUESTS are answered rather than dropped; everything else
  is discarded. The drain counts the discarded frames, classifies each one, and emits **one** WARNING per turn — one
  line regardless of how many frames drained, so a burst cannot flood the log.
  The classification is structural: a JSON-RPC response (`method` is `None`, `id`
  set) whose result carries a non-empty string `stopReason` is by construction
  the abandoned turn's terminal — a response can never reach the permission
  branch, which requires `method` — and an error response is terminal-shaped
  too (a failed turn was still terminated). The warning states the total AND how
  many of the discards were terminal-shaped (explicitly including zero), plus
  their distinct `stopReason` values — closed protocol values (`STOP_REASON_*`)
  only, whitespace-normalized before matching; any other wire string (including
  a non-string) is never logged verbatim. It deliberately does NOT attribute a
  counted response to the abandoned turn: a late error answer to a concurrently
  timed-out command call (re-injected by `_wait_for_response`'s `finally`) is
  indistinguishable in the drain, so the line states the shape, not the owner.
  This matters downstream: a turn whose terminal was destroyed here reaches the
  dashboard as an empty response with no attributable cause. The count is NOT
  bridged into `chat_runner` — see the note below.
- **A prompt stream that ends without a terminal.** `_dispatch_events`
  synthesizes an `EVENT_COMPLETE` on every exit path it knows about, so a
  consumer that never receives one is looking at a path that has none. The
  generator warns when it exhausts CLEANLY having yielded no terminal.
  "Cleanly" is what makes the line spam-free: a consumer close
  (`GeneratorExit`), a cancellation, and any raised error all skip it, and each
  is already logged by whoever caused it. The terminal is marked as delivered
  BEFORE its `yield`, so a consumer that closes the stream on the terminal is not
  reported as having lost it.

**Deliberately not bridged to the runner.** The drain count stays inside this
layer. Reaching `chat_runner` would mean a new field on the `AcpEvent` /
`LLMEvent` provider contract plus plumbing through `_dispatch` and the provider,
and `scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py` baselines the dashboard modules at a
count that may not grow — a materially larger change than the fault it would
report. Unknown `sessionUpdate` discriminants in `_dispatch.py` are still ignored
silently for a related reason: `parse_session_update` is a pure function on a hot
path with no per-session state, so a bounded log there needs a dedupe set it does
not have, and an unbounded one would log per frame.


## AcpRuntime & AcpSessionHandle (session multiplexing)

Alongside `AcpClient` (one `kiro-cli` process per session, guarded by
`_turn_lock`), the ACP package provides **`AcpRuntime`** — a single `kiro-cli`
process that multiplexes **N concurrent sessions** via a single stdout reader
that demuxes frames by `params.sessionId` into per-session queues (no
`_turn_lock`). Each session is fronted by an **`AcpSessionHandle`**; an
**`AcpSessionProvider`** adapts a handle to the `LLMProvider` interface so it is
a drop-in replacement for `AcpClient`.

Both transports share one parser — `acp/_dispatch.py`
(`parse_session_update`, `build_permission_event`, `parse_usage_update`, …) — so
they cannot drift. `AcpRuntime.load_session()` mirrors `AcpClient`'s resume
handshake: it issues `session/load` directly under the original sessionId and
registers the session queue **after** the load response so replayed transcript
frames are dropped rather than counted against the current turn.

They share the stdio framing (`acp/transport_framing.py`), the error taxonomy
(`acp/transport_errors.py`), the model catalog (`acp/runtime_models.py`) and
process-tree inspection (`acp/runtime_process_tree.py`) the same way.

**The runtime tracks its descendants, not just its root.** `spawn()` registers
the launcher PID it created, which on a sandboxed host is two forks above the
process that holds the memory. `_snapshot_descendants()` records the rest into
`kiro_pids.txt` — after the initialize handshake, and at the end of every
`_finish_create_session()` and `load_session()` — and keeps the same
`(start_id, basename)` record shape in `self._child_pids` that
`session_pid._provider_descendant_records` verifies a pid's identity against.
Each pass writes the whole answer for that root — `_replace_child_pids`, one
atomic rewrite that returns whether it landed — because nothing reports a
grandchild's exit, so a record is only ever as good as the last look. The pass
is serialized per runtime, brackets itself with the root's own start identity,
and writes only identities it captured under confirmation: see
[session](session.md) for why writing a freshly read one is a kill-a-stranger
bug rather than a refresh. Each of
the three call sites runs under a cleanup guard, because the scan is reached
with a runtime already `_initialized` or a session already live in the shared
process: a cancellation inside it must tear that down, not abandon it. That in-memory snapshot is the half the
teardown sweep falls back on when the root cannot be walked: a walk enumerates
descendants FROM the root, so a root that exits first leaves its subtree
reparented to init and unreachable. Teardown prunes by descendant liveness and
retains survivors for the orphan sweep. See
[session](session.md) for the file formats and the sweeps that read them.

**A failed start reaps its MCP servers too.** The group kill that ends a failed
spawn or `initialize` handshake reaches only kiro-cli's own process group, and
kiro-cli launches every stdio MCP server as the leader of a group of its own. The
descendant scan above runs only after a successful start, so a runtime that failed
before it had recorded nothing and its MCP servers outlived it untracked. The
failed-start arm of `AcpRuntime._spawn_admitted` therefore scans the tree first
(`_record_tree_before_failed_start_kill`, while the root still links it; POSIX
only), kills
the group, then `_kill_failed_start_escapees` SIGKILLs each recorded descendant
whose identity still matches the scan and prunes the confirmed-dead entries; a
survivor keeps its entry for the orphan sweep. The whole cleanup (stderr settle,
scan, kill, reap) runs as one task, `_failed_start_cleanup`, that the guard only
waits on behind `asyncio.shield`. A cancel of the spawning task, which ordinary
slot signals deliver to the eager-spawn task, is absorbed until the cleanup
settles and is then propagated in place of the original failure. Without that, a
cancel landing inside the scan would drop the only record of the MCP servers.
Pinned by `test/test_acp_runtime_failed_start_reap.py`.

**A reaped root does not end the teardown.** `kill_process_tree` is
`killpg(getpgid(pid))`, and `getpgid` raises once the root has exited — read as
"already dead", that leaves the launcher's children, the agent and its chat
process unsignalled in the group, and a root that died a few seconds into its
life predates every descendant snapshot, so nothing else can find them either.
`AcpRuntime._signal_tree` runs the tree kill only while the root's number is
provably still ours — its live start id matches the one recorded at spawn.
`returncode` is not that proof: asyncio's child watcher does the `waitpid` in
the background and propagates the code a callback later, so a root can be
reaped, its number free for a fresh session leader whose `getpgid` succeeds,
while `returncode` still reads `None`. A root whose identity cannot be read is
treated as gone. It treats a root that is gone, by either read,
as the START of a second path, not the end: the root was spawned as a
session leader, so its pid IS the group id, and
`session_pid._signal_orphaned_runtime_group` finds that group's members and
signals THEM — each re-verified by start id at the instant of the signal — never
the group number, which is the dead root's pid and can be handed to a fresh
session leader at any moment. A member vouches when it carries this runtime's
`KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE` — the per-spawn token `spawn()` puts on the root's
environment, inherited by its whole tree — together with the `KIROCREW_SPAWNED`
marker and a runtime argv identity. The instance is the incarnation pin the
generic marker cannot supply: every runtime is a marked session leader, so a
root pid released to a fresh spawn names a group that carries the marker just
as well, and a signal aimed by number and marker alone would terminate that
fresh runtime's live session. No vouching member, no signal — the number may
be somebody else's by now. A vouched signal is followed by
the same grace a live tree gets and a `SIGKILL` pass, since the root's `wait()`
returned at once and drove no escalation. The escalation never re-resolves the
root's number — `_signal_tree` skips `kill_process_tree` when it carries
`expected`, because `getpgid` on a recycled root pid SUCCEEDS for the fresh
runtime holding it and would have signalled that runtime's group before any
identity check ran — and it re-signals only members the `SIGTERM` pass vouched
that are still alive under the same start id. A shutdown that cancels the teardown
inside the grace still runs that `SIGKILL` pass on the way out, shielded from
the cancellation that triggered it: the members were vouched and signalled, and
the escalation is the only thing still owed.  A further cancel arriving while
that shielded pass is awaited raises at the await and leaves it running
unawaited — `shield` bounds one cancellation, it does not confer immunity. Any other `OSError` (a denied signal)
is final: the root is there and may not be signalled, so its group is not
guessed at. The vouching read is Linux-only (the environ read is), so macOS
keeps the missed reap rather than gain a wrong kill (Windows closes it by handle,
below) — and say so: a
teardown that could resolve neither path logs one WARNING naming the root pid,
the signal and which of the three identity verdicts it got, so the leak is
visible in the field instead of reading as a teardown that worked. The verdict
is deliberately three-valued: only a read that happened and disagreed may
describe the root as no longer ours, while an unrecorded or unreadable identity
refuses just as firmly but reports itself as unmeasured.

**The Windows half of that reaped root is closed, by different evidence.** The
vouching read above is Linux-only (the environ read is), so macOS keeps the
missed reap rather than gain a wrong kill. Windows does not reach that ladder at
all: it has neither a process group to signal nor an inherited token to vouch
with, and `taskkill /T` on a reaped root walks nothing — so instead of naming the
survivors after the fact, it pins them BEFORE the fact. `AcpRuntime._kill_inner`
and `AcpClient._kill_process` both return through
`platform_compat.terminate_windows_asyncio_tree`, draining the tree from handles
opened at spawn against exact creation identities and held across the root's own
exit. That is why a Windows drain may not be softened to best-effort: it is the
only path, where POSIX still has the vouched group behind it. A drain that cannot
confirm the exit of every member it retains raises, keeping the pins and the
tracking for maintenance to retry, and a reservation left unretired blocks client
reset rather than reporting a teardown that worked. What that set does NOT
include is a descendant whose sole ancestry edge vanished before any snapshot saw
it; that residue stays with the orphan sweep and is bounded the same way it was
before this change. The capacity bound this retention needs,
and the manual-handling state an unbounded tree lands in, are owned by
[platform-compat](../common/platform-compat.md#windows-session-tree-teardown).

`AcpClient._kill_process` keeps the same reaped-root window **on POSIX**, and
there it is known and
deferred, not closed here. The client holds no spawn of its own and therefore no
`KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE`, so the vouched group path refuses for it by
construction; reaching its tree needs the client to mint and carry an
incarnation token at spawn time, which is a change to the client's own spawn
path. What it has instead is the descendant snapshot it takes at spawn, which
covers every client root that dies after its first scan; the uncovered case is a
client root that dies before it, and the cost there is the same bounded leak the
orphan sweep reports. On Windows the client needs neither the token nor the scan:
its spawn is owned, so the drain reaches a root that died before any scan ran.

**An ownerless server→client request is answered ONCE, at connection level.**
An inbound frame carrying an `id` **and** a `method` but no `params.sessionId`
is a request that names no session — it expects exactly one response, so the
reader answers it itself with `-32601 Method not found`
(`_answer_ownerless_request`, run off the reader loop) and never broadcasts
it. Broadcasting would hand it to every
registered session's dispatch loop, each of which would reply `-32601` on the
shared stdin — one request id, N responses, widening with session sharing. Only
true notifications (method, no id) broadcast. The routed case — an unknown
request **with** a `sessionId` — still gets its single per-session reply from
that session's dispatch loop (`server_request_unknown`).

**KAS auth has two owners, chosen by the vault.** KAS is reached through
kiro-cli's ACP relay (`build_kas_argv` in `acp/kas_transport.py`), which forwards
unrelated NDJSON frames byte-for-byte. Without a vault identity the relay runs
with `--auth-method cli`, consumes `_kiro/auth/getAccessToken` itself and resolves
tokens from kiro-cli's own store, so Crew never sees that frame. With a vault
identity the flag is omitted and Crew answers `_kiro/auth/getAccessToken` from
the vault (`_answer_get_access_token`); [kas-auth.md](kas-auth.md) owns that
contract. For the relay-owned case, one consequence is
recorded in KAS's auth declaration and reaches callers as
`backends_retired_by_host_logout()`: because the relay signs in from kiro-cli's
store, a KAS runtime is retired by an external `kiro-cli logout` on the same terms
as the kiro backend. A second is that the KAS process gets no OS
sandbox of its own — the relay spawns its server without `--sandbox` and the
agent resolves an absent config to a no-op backend — so Crew's own sandbox stays
engaged for this backend and KAS is excluded from
`ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`.

**Off-loop answers are bounded.** The off-loop answers — the unroutable-permission
auto-reject, the KAS access-token answer and the MCP sign-in answer
(`_kiro/openExternalUrl`) — can block on stdin `drain()` before writing their
response, so the reader schedules them without blocking stdout demux but keeps a
strong reference in one shared `_answer_tasks` set under `_max_answer_tasks` —
every path contends for the same stdin, so a second per-kind cap would allow the
combined resource total to exceed the bound. The done callback removes completed
tasks. At capacity these answers use a bounded discrimination wait: one
completion admits the pending answer, while no progress within the bound marks
the runtime dead so pending waiters resolve explicitly. The one exception is the
`-32601` answer to an ownerless request: past the cap it takes the counted-drop
path by design, so a flooding backend hangs on its own unanswered request instead
of growing the task set.

**Unroutable frames are counted, not logged per frame.** The reader drops any
frame it cannot route; the drop itself is correct and unchanged, but logging one
`DEBUG` line per dropped frame is a log-retention hazard on a multiplexed
backend. Every frame for a torn-down or not-yet-registered sessionId takes that
branch — including the entire transcript replay of a `session/load` (the queue is
registered after the response, above) — and a backend that keeps streaming after
teardown makes it an unbounded **steady state**, not a burst. Measured on an
operator host: ~60 lines/second sustained for 6+ hours from one gateway PID,
33–59% of every `gateway.log` rotation, which at
`RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB, backupCount=3)` (`cli.py`) rolled the
diagnostics an incident needed out of the retained 8MB window before they could
be read. So `_reader_loop` funnels every **frame-rate** drop — a between-turn update for
a registered session, a frame whose `sessionId` is not registered, an ownerless
request past the answer cap, and a no-`sessionId` global notification arriving
while zero sessions are registered (sentinel `_DROP_NO_SESSION`) — through
`_note_dropped_frame()`, which also emits the `kirocrew.acp.dropped_frames`
counter (`method_class` label), which tallies `(sessionId, method)` and emits
one `DEBUG` summary carrying the accumulated count at most every
`_DROP_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` (60s). The key stays **per session** deliberately:
the decisive signal in the incident was that two *different* session UUIDs were
flooding at once, which a single global tally would hide. The level stays `DEBUG`
— the goal is far fewer lines, not louder ones. The roster-truncation warning above
reuses this counter's shape rather than inventing a second one, and binds its
interval to `_DROP_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` for the same reason: one value answers
"how often may a suppressed high-frequency condition restate itself in
`gateway.log`", and a second knob is a second throttle to reason about in the same
module. `_reader_loop`'s `finally` flushes both summaries, because the reader is
the only thing that feeds either.

Three properties make the counter safe on the demux hot path: it never awaits
(no timer task to leak — the flush rides the next drop), the map is bounded
(`_DROP_SUMMARY_MAX_KEYS` = 64 distinct keys forces an early flush instead of
growth, and both backend-controlled key halves pass through
`redact_backend_text` — the same redact-whole-or-refuse-by-length policy behind
`_loggable_request_id` — **before** they are capped to
`_DROP_SUMMARY_KEY_MAX_CHARS` = 80, so the retained and later-logged key can
never hold a credential severed at the cut), and the residual count is flushed in the
loop's `finally` on **every** exit (EOF, exhausted oversize-drain budget, cancel,
crash) so a low-rate trickle is reported late rather than swallowed. No lock is
needed: `_reader_loop` is the sole writer (`spawn()` creates exactly one reader
task). The two response-shaped drop branches (non-numeric id, unmatched id) stay
per-frame on purpose — the id is their whole diagnostic value and is distinct per
frame, so aggregating by it would give the counter an unbounded key space while
aggregating without it would discard the only identifying datum; both are also
bounded by the requests this runtime issued, so neither has the after-teardown
steady state.

**An oversize stdout line is a dropped frame, not a dead runtime.** A single
JSON-RPC line over the reader's `_STDOUT_BUFFER_LIMIT` (10 MB) used to
`_mark_dead` the runtime, which fails every pending future and poisons every
session queue — so one huge frame ended *every* session multiplexed on that
process mid-turn, surfacing to users as "process exited / chat failure". Both ACP
readers did this on the strength of a claim that asyncio leaves the stream
corrupted after an overrun and every subsequent read also fails. That claim is
false: `StreamReader.readline` repairs the buffer *before* raising `ValueError`
(deleting the oversize line through its terminating newline when one is buffered,
else clearing the buffer) and resumes the transport, as its own docstring states.

So `_reader_loop` reads through `readuntil(b"\n")` and, on `LimitOverrunError`,
hands the line to `_drain_oversize_line()`, which consumes it **entirely, through
its terminating newline**, and discards it — the same consume-prefix-and-retry
drain as `mcp_gateway/backend.py::run_stdout_pump`, where a plain `read(n)` would
eat into the *next* frame. Draining the whole line rather than one prefix at a
time is load-bearing, not tidiness: the unterminated branch's discard boundary is
an arbitrary byte offset (`consumed = len(buffer)`), so surfacing the remainder as
a line hands the parser a byte-slice that can start mid-character. The parse step
skips such a slice: it reads every line through
`kiro_crew.json_line.parse_json_object_line` with replacement decoding, so a line
that is not a JSON object (undecodable bytes, a bare scalar or array, nesting past
the decoder's ceiling, an integer past the int-string digit limit) is dropped with
a debug log and never reaches the loop's crash handler, which would kill every
multiplexed session. Draining through the newline keeps the reader on a frame
boundary, so the next frame parses whole.

A dropped frame can be the reply to an awaited request -- a `session/new` or
`session/load` reply lists every agent in `~/.kiro/agents` with its description
and `welcomeMessage`, so an agent package with very large welcomeMessage text
pushes it over the limit. The drain therefore keeps the line's first
`_OVERSIZE_HEAD_BYTES` (never parsed as a frame), and when that head is a reply
envelope (no `"method"`) whose numeric `id` is a pending awaited request, that
request fails at once with `AcpFrameTooLarge`, naming the frame's size and the
limit. It is not `transient`, and the `session/new` and `session/load` arms tag it
`session_start_failed`, so a self-driving caller counts it and backs off as it
does for a stalled start. Without this the caller timed out much later under an unrelated name (a
`session/new` timeout reads as slow MCP servers). A frame whose head names no
pending request keeps the timeout path, and the warning still lists the ids in
flight.

Because this reader is a standalone task with no deadline, an endlessly
unterminated stream still needs a terminal state, so the drain carries a budget of
`_OVERSIZE_DRAIN_MAX_BYTES` (160 MB) and raises `OversizeLineUnrecoverable` past
it, which the loop turns into `_mark_dead`. The budget counts **bytes** and is
scoped to a single drain call — deliberately *not* a count of oversize *frames*,
and needing no cross-iteration state because every call that returns ends on a
frame boundary. A replay of properly terminated but oversize frames therefore
stays survivable frame after frame; a frame counter would reproduce the very
defect this replaces. The liveness oracle cannot substitute for the budget: it
judges by CPU/IO movement, and a garbage-spewing stream moves both, so it would
report `WORKING`.

A pending request whose response was in a dropped frame is not orphaned —
`_send_and_await` wraps every future in `wait_for(timeout=…)`, so the caller gets
a timeout; the warning names the request ids in flight at the drop so that timeout
is attributable. `AcpClient._read_message` takes the same drop-and-continue stance
by returning `None` (joining its blank-line and non-JSON paths) but keeps
`readline` and carries **no** budget: every call there is bounded by the caller's
`timeout` and the callers run their own deadlines, so the worst case is one turn
ending on its deadline rather than unbounded state.

Every session on an `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` backend (kiro, KAS, Codex) runs on
`AcpRuntime` + `AcpSessionHandle`: `AcpProvider.start()` (`providers/acp.py`)
branches on `is_acp_runtime_backend` and wraps an `AcpSessionHandle` in
`AcpSessionProvider` — so main chat, dashboard, cron, and subagents all run on
the runtime rather than a per-session `AcpClient`. The Claude backend keeps the
per-session `AcpClient`. Additional consumers:
`AcpRuntime` also powers the `_bg` pool, (when `agent.session_sharing` is on)
the shared parent+subagents runtime, and **Code Review Sage's `ReviewPool`**
(`apps/builtins/code_review_sage/sage_lib/review_pool.py`) — one batch-scoped
`AcpRuntime` multiplexing one `AcpSessionHandle` per PR under a concurrency
semaphore (`review.max_concurrent`, default 5, ceiling 30), spawned on batch
start and `kill()`ed when the batch drains, with each per-PR session
`destroy()`ed on completion for context isolation. Because the runtime layer has
no `audit_source`, the pool re-emits the equivalent per-tool SEL audit itself
(see the `audit_source` note above). See `providers.md` and `subagent.md`.

**A process exit has a fixed reason format.** `AcpRuntime._exit_reason` reports
`process exited (rc=N)`, and for a signal death names the signal beside it
(`rc=-15 (signal SIGTERM)`, `_rc_phrase`). A stderr line is promoted to the cause
only when `_proven_death_cause` matches a registration-throttle line or the
`no space left on device` signature (which adds the `kirocrew doctor` hint);
otherwise the redacted last stderr line goes to DEBUG, and the card keeps its
separate `stderr_tail` field.

**Death-log severity is a contract: expected teardowns are INFO, genuine deaths
are WARNING.** `_mark_dead(reason, *, expected=False)` logs the single
`AcpRuntime dead (PID …) [returncode=…] stderr_tail: …` line at INFO when the
death is a deliberate teardown and at WARNING otherwise; the flag changes
severity only — futures still fail with `AcpRuntimeDead`, queues are still
poisoned. `kill(*, expected=False)` plumbs it through, and both defaults are
fail-safe (WARNING), so `initialize()`'s failed-handshake cleanup and any
call site that does not opt in warns. A call site passes `expected=True` when the
death is deliberate: the deliberate teardowns of a healthy runtime (session
shutdown via `AcpSessionProvider`, `_bg`/subagent runtime recycling and shutdown,
`ReviewPool` batch drain), and cleanup kills that have already logged their own
cause, such as `AcpProvider`'s failed-session-setup kill, which emits a WARNING
naming the setup failure before it kills. This list is illustrative, not closed. `_mark_dead` refuses the downgrade when the process already
exited on its own (`returncode` set), so a replacement path reaping a death
the reader loop has not yet marked keeps the WARNING whenever the exit has
already been observed — best-effort: an exit the child watcher has not yet
recorded can still take the INFO path in that narrow window. The warm-pool
health sweep and the claim path (`_drain_and_claim`) follow the same rule: a
TTL recycle of a healthy provider logs at INFO, while a provider found dead —
in a TTL branch or a dead-provider branch — stays WARNING. Note the default
`agent.log_level` is WARNING, so expected teardowns are absent from
`gateway.log` unless the operator raises verbosity; that silence is the point
of the split (issue #4052).

**The death line is written before the signal, so its exit status is filled in
afterwards — on BOTH teardown branches.** A kill marks the death while the child
is still running, so the retained summary carries `[returncode=<not reaped>]`
rather than a bare `returncode=None`. `_note_reaped_after_kill` replaces the
placeholder once the reap has completed and the handle is still held, and logs one
line at the death's own severity. It is called from the POSIX ladder AND from the
Windows owned-handle drain, which returns from `_kill_inner` on its own and so
cannot inherit the ladder's call — a status recorded on one platform only is a
gap the other platform's operator pays for, since the summary outlives the log and
rides `AcpProcessDied` into a turn's error and a cron's `last_error`. The
amendment is silent when the status is still unknown: a POSIX pair of timed-out
waits, or a Windows drain that raised because it could not confirm every member's
exit, both leave `<not reaped>` standing, which is then true.

Pinned on every platform rather than on the Windows shards alone
(`test_the_windows_branch_amends_the_summary_too`,
`test_an_unconfirmed_windows_drain_leaves_the_placeholder` in
`test/test_acp_runtime.py`, which force the branch through
`platform_compat.IS_WINDOWS`): a branch one CI lane reaches is a branch whose loss
is invisible in every other lane. The shared kill test double drains the Windows
tree by awaiting `process.wait()` for the same reason the real
`terminate_windows_asyncio_tree` does — that await is what populates `returncode`,
so a double returning without it would report the placeholder on Windows and hide
the amendment behind its own unfaithfulness.

**An exit the reader OBSERVES retires the registry entries too, once it is
confirmed.** `_kill_inner` drops the root's `kiro_pids.txt` /
`kiro_session_pids.txt` lines after its own reap. A root killed from outside — an
OOM kill, a `pkill`, an operator — reaches no kill: the reader loop hits EOF,
`_mark_dead` unshields the pid in memory, and the two lines used to stand until
the periodic sweep's next tick, bounded only by
`SessionCleanup.MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS` (measured on the nightly leak gate: a
SIGKILLed background runtime stayed tracked for 293s). Both observed-EOF returns
of the reader — the empty read, and `IncompleteReadError` while draining an
oversize line — now call `_retire_tracking_after_exit`, which waits for the exit
under the kill path's `_KILL_REAP_TIMEOUT`, amends the death summary with the
measured code (logged as `reaped after an observed exit`, a literal template
distinct from the kill path's `reaped after kill`, because a log line that says
"killed" must name who killed), re-probes `pid_exists`, and retires the ROOT's
lines off the loop (`asyncio.to_thread`, since the untrack takes the file locks
the sweep contends for). EOF is not the only confirmed-exit observer: the
`_exit_watch_loop` task — started beside the reader at spawn and cancelled beside
it in teardown — polls the root's own `process.returncode` and calls the same
`_retire_tracking_after_exit` on the exit. It polls rather than awaiting
`process.wait()` for a load-bearing reason: `wait()`'s waiters are woken only
from the event loop's `_call_connection_lost`, after every pipe transport
disconnects, so a descendant holding stdout open parks `wait()` exactly as long
as it parks the reader — awaiting it would make the watcher inert for the very
case it exists to catch. `returncode` is set by `_process_exited` (the
SIGCHLD/`waitpid` path) the instant the root is reaped, independent of the pipes,
so the poll sees the exit regardless of the still-open stdout.
It covers the case EOF cannot: a
descendant that inherited the root's stdout write end holds that pipe open after
the root dies, so the reader parked on `readuntil` never sees EOF and the death
would otherwise stay invisible until the survivor exits or idle expiry force-reaps
(~1h). It keys on a non-`None` returncode, never on a closed pipe, so the "closed
stdout is NOT an exit" contract holds; `_mark_dead` is idempotent. Before the mark the
watcher drains the final frames in bounded slices: it sleeps `_EXIT_DRAIN_GRACE`
(0.05 s) at a time for at most `_EXIT_DRAIN_MAX` (1 s), continuing while the reader
keeps stamping activity or holds buffered input, so a completed turn's last
response is routed and a same-instant EOF drives the reader's path first, so the two
observers never double-retire. The write is bound to the PROCESS, not the number: the
reader has no process left to re-check, and the freed number can be handed to a
replacement root this gateway just tracked before the write lands, so
`session_pid._untrack_root_by_identity(pid, start_token)` removes, under the
session file's lock, only the line equal to `<gw>:<pid>:<start_token>` where the
token is the one `AcpRuntime` read at spawn (`_spawn_start_token`); a different
or absent token, or no token to compare, touches nothing. The bare
`kiro_pids.txt` line carries no identity, and a successor handed the number may
have no session line of its own yet (its spawn has appended the bare line and not
reached the session write), so the session file cannot say whether the number has
a new holder — the kernel can: `_untrack_pid_if_dead` probes `pid_exists` INSIDE
`_pid_file_lock`, the lock `_track_pid` appends under, and removes the bare line
only when the number is dead at that moment. A live holder keeps it: it cannot be
mid-append while the probe holds the lock, so its bare line is either already
there or is the one its own `_track_pid` writes next, and the sweep prunes any
dead bare line within its tick. `pid_exists` treats EPERM as alive. The two
per-file locks are taken in turn, never nested, and no lock spans the pair. The
call reports whether every write it owed committed — a refused `kiro_pids.txt`
rewrite is reported as `False`, not as a clean retirement. Every other doubt
retains too: a closed stdout is not an exit (a backend can close its pipe and
keep running), a wait that times out or a pid that still answers keeps the lines,
and an untrack that raises is logged at debug like the kill path's. Descendant
lines are deliberately left alone — a child that outlived the root is reparented
and still running, and its own `kiro_pids.txt` line is what the sweep reaps it
by. Pinned by `test_observed_exit_retires_registry_entries_once_reaped`,
`test_observed_exit_keeps_tracking_while_the_root_still_runs` and
`test_eof_inside_an_oversize_line_retires_the_same_way` in
`test/test_acp_runtime.py`, and by the `_untrack_root_by_identity` cases in
`test/test_pid_lifecycle.py`.

**Every writer of a root's registry lines is bound to the identity read at
spawn.** Both spawn paths (`AcpRuntime._spawn_admitted`, `AcpClient._spawn`) read
`_pid_start_token` ONCE, keep it as `_spawn_start_token`, and hand it to
`_track_session_pid(pid, start_token)`, so the line written and the line later
compared are one read of the identity rather than two — two probes of one number
are two reads that can disagree once the number changes hands. `_track_session_pid`
keeps ONE line per `gw:pid` number: the exact entry already present is a re-track
and is left alone; a line under the same number carrying a DIFFERENT token is a
predecessor's — the caller is recording the process that holds the number NOW, so
whatever that line named has exited — and it is REPLACED rather than kept (a kept
stale line is the hole identity-bound retirement fell through: the successor never
got a line, so nothing about it was ever in the file); a token-less write never
replaces a tokened line, since it has no identity to offer; a refused replacement
raises, like a refused append, because a live root recorded nowhere is the one
unrecoverable direction. The kill paths retire by identity too: `_kill_inner` and
`AcpClient._reset_state` call `_untrack_root_by_identity(pid, _spawn_start_token)`
after their reap — "confirmed dead" is a fact about the process, not about its
number, which a root spawned since can already hold, and the prefix-matched
untrack they used before took the successor's lines with it. When identity
retirement finds no line of ours (spawn's append failed, or a successor already
replaced it) the bare line goes through `_untrack_pid_if_dead`, never by number
alone; a root whose identity could not be read at spawn has no token to compare
and keeps the prefix-matched untrack it always had. Before replacing another
line, `_track_session_pid` re-reads the number's identity under the lock and
writes only while it still names the process the token belongs to: a LATE tracker
— one running after its own root died and the number was handed on — would
otherwise take the live successor's only record for a stale predecessor's; the
re-read is an occupancy check, never the source of what is written. `AcpRuntime`
now runs its tracking pair off the loop in one executor hop, as `AcpClient._spawn`
does: each tracker takes an exclusive file lock and, on a recycled number, now
rewrites the file under it. The hop is an await between the method's two reap
guards, so its own guard first WAITS for the worker (an append landing after the
reap has untracked the pid would resurrect a line for a dead, recyclable number),
then reaps, then lets the cancellation through — and both steps run as one task
the guard only waits on behind `asyncio.shield`, absorbing a repeated `cancel()`
(a newer slot signal, then a slot deletion, both target the same eager-spawn task)
until the reap has settled, so being cancelled twice cannot skip it. Pinned by the `_track_session_pid` cases and
`test_reset_state_retires_by_identity_when_a_spawn_token_is_held` in
`test/test_pid_lifecycle.py`, `TestAcpRuntimePidTracking` in
`test/test_acp_runtime.py`, and `TestRuntimeRootTrackingOffLoop` in
`test/test_acp_spawn_offload.py`.

### Codex MCP result envelopes

The parser extracts `rawOutput.result.content` text from successful Codex MCP
results before session-directive decoding. Call identity and raw arguments stay
on the native MCP call, including calls issued through `functions.exec`. A
result wrapper is not an identity source. The session consumer binds fallback
delivery to the identified tool's arguments and the requesting session/turn.

The Codex spawn environment sets `DISABLE_MCP_CONFIG_FILTERING=true` so the
adapter honors the session's MCP overrides even when a global configuration
contains the same server name. This applies to both create and load; it changes
configuration precedence, not authentication or the sandbox's credential mask.

The Codex spawn environment also sets `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`, so concurrent
`codex app-server` processes (Codex Desktop and each Crew runtime) do not share
one set of SQLite databases and fail new sessions with `database is locked`. The
harness names the need (`SpawnPlan.private_state_env`) and the runtime points the
variable at its own per-process scratch directory -- the one `TMPDIR` already
names, allocated before the sandbox wrap and reclaimed by
`agent_scratch.sweep_dead_scratch` once the process is dead -- so no new tree,
lock or slot exists. Only the databases move: config, auth and the thread
rollouts stay in `CODEX_HOME`, and a thread resumes from its rollout (measured on
codex 0.159), so `spawn_continue` works across runtimes. A value the operator
set, or one a cron or workflow `extra_env` carries, reaches the child as set.
Without a scratch directory nothing is set and one warning is logged: the child
gets codex's shared default rather than a refused spawn.

The rebuild cost is paid on every start, not once. The scratch directory lives
and dies with its process, so each new chat, resume, subagent, cron run and
knowledge worker that starts Codex begins on an empty database home and rebuilds
codex's index from the rollouts in `CODEX_HOME`. The cost scales with the
user's Codex history: reported on codex 0.159 with about 3,200 threads (7.5 GB
of rollouts), `initialize` took about 60 s and wrote about 400 MB per runtime,
against 0.2 s on the shared home. On that host dashboard model discovery for a
Codex crew gave up before `initialize` answered, so the model picker offered
only `auto`. The operator workaround is to set `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` in the gateway's
own environment (for a systemd user unit, `Environment=CODEX_SQLITE_HOME=%h/.codex`
in a drop-in), which restores the shared, warm index and gives up the isolation
from other `codex app-server` processes that this section exists for.
