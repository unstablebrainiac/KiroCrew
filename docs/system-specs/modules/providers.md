# LLM Provider Abstraction

Kiro Crew drives every LLM through one seam: the `LLMProvider` ABC in
`providers/base.py`. `AcpProvider` (`providers/acp.py`) is the only implementation
the factory selects; `AcpSessionProvider` (`acp/session_provider.py`) is a second
concrete subclass, the adapter a shared-runtime session is swapped onto once
`AcpRuntime` is up.
`agent.provider` is fixed to `"acp"` (enum `["acp"]`) — the provider is not the
harness selector. **Which harness that one provider drives is a separate
decision, taken from `agent_sdk/backends.py`**: `agent.acp_backend` names a backend id
and `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` decides which ids an operator may choose.
Several are selectable on a plain public build, so "one provider" never meant
"one backend".

## Architecture

Member execution carries one immutable member/store selection into provider
allocation. `member_context` controls native instruction deduplication; it is not
a security capability and does not choose a database. Memory access uses the
Gateway's captured execution record and ordinary authenticated transport.

Retention mode is established before provider startup. A restricted session is
one whose `memory_mode` is `incognito` or `temporary` (any non-persistent mode;
[session.md](session.md) owns the term). Restricted sessions bypass
resumable warm providers, suppress Crew raw frame recording and discard known
native transcript files on teardown, including a declined late startup. A shared
runtime suppresses recording once it receives a restricted session. Provider
stderr and reader-exception text are also excluded from restricted diagnostics;
exit codes and the authentication-failure signal remain available. Provider
engines can still write their own files during a live process; teardown cleanup
cannot guarantee removal after a crash or for undocumented engine storage.

The ordinary host sandbox and backend capability checks apply independently.
Member memory requires no extra OS filesystem view, HMAC capability or platform
isolation admission. See [the memory contract](memory-skills-hooks.md).

```

`agent_sdk/backends.py` is the selection authority: it defines the ids, the membership
floor (`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`), the selectable baseline, and every capability set a
backend opts into. Do not re-describe that seam here —
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md) holds the invariants that keep the Kiro
path from being widened for an adapted harness,
[harness-onboarding.md](harness-onboarding.md) the sequence a new harness walks,
and [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md) the host obligations every
adapted backend meets, KAS included, as a worked example. The transport itself (framing, timeouts, binary resolution,
config isolation) is [acp-client.md](acp-client.md); this file owns the
*interface*.

**One provider, by invariant:** `AcpProvider` is the only provider the factory
builds, and `agent.provider` stays `enum=["acp"]`. There is no Bedrock or
standalone provider and no multi-provider dispatch factory, because a second
`agent.provider` value would route around every harness-parity invariant.

The Claude Code harness has its own page: [claude-code-provider.md](claude-code-provider.md).


## Essential-context delivery contract

Application code imports `ContextPromptProvider`, `ContextStreamEvent` and
`context_provider_of` through `kiro_crew.agent_sdk`, never through the provider
or ACP packages. The SDK driver admits real provider classes without evaluating
dynamic proxy attributes. Event protocols expose only the read-only evidence the
receipt needs; the receipt stream preserves the caller's concrete event type.

`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.drivers.acp.projected_session_mcp_servers(agent, *, work_dir=None)`
is a synchronous driver helper for the deterministic workflow test scenario,
not a top-level SDK export. It returns the existing filtered list of dictionaries
and preserves resolver errors; async callers offload it. Projection itself neither
authenticates the caller nor starts a server. Ordinary provider capability checks
and authenticated transport remain responsible for admission; canonical execution
records supply memory routing.

A caller holding its normal session lease supplies the actual `LLMProvider` as
`context_provider=provider` to `ContextBuilder.build_message`, together with the
trusted `session_key`, resolved `memory_store`, execution `agent`, project and
scope flags. The builder validates and renders a complete snapshot and stages it
in `provider.essential_delivery`; building or previewing is never acknowledgment.
Previews omit `context_provider`. Shared-runtime callers pass their own project
explicitly, rather than inferring a per-session cwd from the shared runtime.

The returned prompt remains complete and may undergo the caller's normal prefix
transforms. Send it through `provider.stream(prompt)` or `stream_and_collect`.
No caller-side acknowledgment call is needed. ACP implementations match the exact
staged envelope, remove it only when the same scope/content is acknowledged in
that native conversation, and acknowledge only a raw successful end-turn after
non-control output or tool activity. Empty, synthetic, cancelled and failed
attempts cannot commit a receipt. Closing a stream after its genuine terminal is
supported; closing earlier invalidates the receipt. Compaction, conversation
clear, agent switch and client/process replacement invalidate prior evidence,
including an in-flight candidate. `kiro_crew.agent_sdk` names every invalidating
observation (`CONTEXT_EVENT_COMPACTION`, `CONTEXT_EVENT_CLEAR`,
`CONTEXT_EVENT_AGENT_CHANGED`; the set is `essential_delivery
.RECEIPT_INVALIDATING_EVENTS`). Both ACP providers also invalidate BEFORE
dispatching a history-discarding slash command (`/compact` and `/clear`, the
`RECEIPT_RESETTING_COMMANDS` set, applied through `EssentialDelivery
.prepare_command`), because the status notification can be absent (a backend
that treats the command as plain text) or arrive only inside the next turn's
stream; other slash commands keep prior evidence. A `/clear` empties the native
history while the session id and process stay the same, so without this the
next warm turn would deduplicate against an acknowledgment the conversation no
longer holds. The receipt observes events yielded inside a `stream` or
`stream_command`. If a between-turn notification is yielded only after the next
prompt is written, an otherwise unchanged warm prompt can omit essentials before
that event invalidates the receipt. Whether kiro-cli emits such between-turn
notifications, and whether the queued frame surfaces before or after the next
prompt is written, has not been established by a live run (see "Native harness
notifications relied on" below).

### Native harness notifications relied on

This dedup depends on the harness reporting every native context loss it
performs. That is not an ACP-spec guarantee: the public ACP protocol defines no
compaction or truncation notification, and `_kiro.dev/*` is a Kiro-private
extension without a published contract. What the code relies on, per backend:

- kiro-cli: `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` (every `status.type`, including
  started, completed, failed and the recovery variants, maps to
  `compaction_status`), `_kiro.dev/clear/status` (→ `clear_status`) and
  `_kiro.dev/agent/switched` (→ `agent_switched`). Evidence is the shipped
  binary's own method strings (kiro-cli 2.21.4) plus the local parsers in
  `acp/client.py` and `acp/session_handle.py`; no end-to-end run against a real
  kiro-cli has confirmed that every silent trim path emits one of these.
- KAS: `summarization_started/completed/failed` session-info frames map to
  `compaction_status`; `/compact` and `/clear` are plain prompt text there,
  which is why the command path pre-invalidates instead of waiting.
- claude-agent-acp: the adapter announces a compaction with a `Compacting`
  started text but emits `completed` only for a manual `/compact`; an
  automatic mid-turn compaction leaves that started dangling (only a
  `usage_update` follows), and `AcpClient` synthesizes the `completed`
  `compaction_status` at the turn's `end_turn` terminal. This is a heuristic on
  adapter text output, the weakest of the three.

History loss without any observed invalidation is not detected by the receipt:
unchanged warm turns can continue omitting the snapshot until another invalidation,
content change or conversation replacement requires delivery. A notification
observed only after a prompt was dispatched cannot repair that already-sent
prompt; it invalidates the receipt for subsequent delivery. Neither behavior is
a guarantee that a silent trim recovers on the next turn.

`context_provider_type` reports the actual backend label, independent of the
installation's `agent.provider` setting. `native_context_documents` defaults to
empty. Kiro's launch plan captures admitted selected-template sources after
materialization and governance checks. Successful activation of that same agent
in the same cwd transfers source responsibility to the handle. This relies on
Kiro's supported `--agent` prompt/resources contract, not a per-file model receipt.
Changes to a launch-version source receive a complete manual replacement.
Kiro's implicit workspace-root AGENTS and default/always steering in project and
global steering directories also belong to that launch contract, even when no
resource glob declares them, while the workspace inherits kiro-cli's default
resources; an opted-out workspace's contract is its declared sources alone. The
opt-out is kiro-cli's own setting, so it applies only when kiro-cli serves the
session: every other harness keeps the inheriting contract, and the non-member
folder-steering dedup follows the same decision.
SOUL is native-owned only when explicitly declared.
The mirrored steering reference records engine/version differences for conditional
modes, so Kiro uses the fallback selector instead of claiming full native support.

Folder steering is deliberately NOT part of that launch contract. A chat filed
into a folder that declares `steering_dirs` (see [config](config.md)) has those
directories read by `kiro_crew.folder_steering.collect_folder_steering` and the
resulting documents placed into session-start context by the context builder, for
EVERY provider — kiro-cli, Claude Code, Codex, KAS, and any config-authored
harness — with no provider branch on that path. `SpawnContext`, `AcpRuntime` and
the harnesses carry no folder-steering field, so every harness produces an
identical `SpawnPlan` for a folder chat and a non-folder chat; delivery cannot be
lost by adding a provider. A file whose realpath lies under the chat project's
`.kiro/steering` or under `~/.kiro/steering` is skipped ONLY where the active provider
already delivers those trees -- kiro-cli loads them natively while the workspace
inherits kiro-cli's default resources, the Claude Code seam receives the explicit
steering load, KAS reports `native_steering` -- so they are not sent twice; on a
harness with no such path (Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Goose, DeepSeek) the folder
delivers them like any other document rather than skipping rules nothing else
would carry. Documents honor the steering
`inclusion` frontmatter (`always`, or absent, is included; `manual`, `auto` and
`fileMatch` are skipped and left to their native trigger), and each file is
admitted against its own declared directory as the trust base, so a symlink can
never read outside the root the operator pointed at. A root that is, contains,
or lies inside a memory store (every configured V1 workspace -- the default
`workspace/` under the crew data home and each `workspaces` entry, wherever its
directory points -- or the `memory_stores/` tree) is refused by the folder API
and skipped by the collector (compared casefolded, so an alternate-case spelling on a case-insensitive filesystem is the same silo): a named memory store is a silo, and folder
steering must not carry one store's Markdown into another store's prompt. The
fence is built from the configuration's `workspaces` table, and while that table
cannot be read (an unparseable `config.json` or a non-object `workspaces` value,
which the loader records as a degraded section rather than repairing to `{}`) the
fence is INCOMPLETE and fails closed: the folder API refuses to admit any steering
directory (clearing to `[]` still works), and the collector reads nothing and
emits a `[FOLDER STEERING OMISSION: ...]` line saying so -- the default
directories alone are not the fence when an operator's external workspace may be
missing from it. An unparseable `config.json` is remembered for the life of the
gateway (fail-closed and sticky), so the fence stays incomplete until the file is
repaired AND the gateway restarted; a degradation of the `workspaces` value alone
clears once the file is repaired. The
stored value is bounded as STORED (the canonical spelling, after `~` and link
expansion), and re-validated per entry on every resolve: a directory that has
since vanished or become refused is skipped with a warning while the rest of the
chain still steers; only a malformed stored shape fails the resolution.
The section's own frame,
`[FOLDER STEERING — …]` / `[END FOLDER STEERING]`, is a prompt-boundary marker in
the same set as `[CURRENT USER REQUEST —]`: a copy planted in a channel message,
a memory line or a steering body is neutralized by the session-context scrub and
by the renderer's body scrub, and the genuine frame is minted AFTER that scrub
(outside the `[SESSION CONTEXT …]` block on a fresh session, and around the
already-scrubbed bodies on compaction reinjection), so only the operator-selected
section ever carries it. The non-member section is
capped like the existing steering section; a member (private-memory) chat carries
the documents inside its essentials envelope instead, which applies its own
document-count and per-source byte bounds; a private-member chat in Temporary
memory mode receives no folder steering, exactly as that mode withholds the
member's project documents (the envelope is built with reads blocked), whereas a
non-member Temporary chat still receives it. Collection itself is bounded twice --
a 64-document ceiling on what is read and a 4096-entry ceiling per root on what
is enumerated -- and a ceiling that fires is never silent: the section ends with
one `[FOLDER STEERING OMISSION: …]` line per fired ceiling stating what the model
is not seeing in the terms the walk saw it -- unexamined Markdown candidates past
the document ceiling; and, past the entry ceiling, the Markdown files the listing
had already produced but will never read (counted as files) separately from the
directories never listed or entered (counted as directories, a floor) -- and a member
envelope that had to drop a tail carries the same counts as one extra
`folder-steering://omitted` essentials document, so a capped tree never reads
like a complete one. After provider compaction the section is re-injected under
a `[REINJECTED AFTER COMPACTION — folder steering]` line. The tree is read only
through descriptor-pinned directory handles (parent chain pinned, each child
opened relative to its parent with `O_NOFOLLOW`, one descriptor per level of the
active ancestry); on a platform that cannot open a directory relative to a
descriptor (native Windows) the folder API refuses a non-empty `steering_dirs`
before any filesystem call and the collector skips a stored value with a
warning, because a by-name `isdir`/`realpath` on a swapped junction is itself
the outbound SMB probe.

KAS inline prompts and file resources come from the actual `customAgents`
definition sent by `session/new`. File expansion uses that definition, not a
reread of a possibly different project template. Successful activation publishes
those source versions to the direct `AcpSessionProvider`; other agents' definitions
cannot supply its ownership. Resource URIs and their order remain unchanged on
the wire, and conditional, skill and knowledge resources keep native selection.
Exact template and body matches omit initial manual copies. The complete-envelope
budget is checked BEFORE omission: 64,000 characters including wrappers, with
whole guides left out and named when it is exceeded
([memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md)); reads
refuse above 256,000 bytes per source, and resource expansion is bounded to 64
unique documents. KAS's existing registration ceiling is 50 custom agents, not a
file-body budget. An id in `agent_files.KAS_RESERVED_AGENT_IDS` (`default` and
the built-in mode ids `vibe`, `spec`, `quick-spec`, `bug-fix`, `plan`,
`autonomous`; exact, case-sensitive) is refused by the projection before
`session/new` -- the engine accepts such an entry and either drops it or keeps
its own built-in under the id, so it would surface only as an unadvertised mode
or as the built-in running under the crewmate's name -- and the refusal names
the crewmate-side remedy (`crew-mode.md`, "Template names the harness cannot
activate"). This repository does not establish a universal native model or
resource truncation limit; real harness versions still need that integration check.
Resume and replacement snapshots retain complete text. Frameworks without native steering receive a
conditional discovery index: the agent reads a guide only after its explicit
manual, file-pattern or description-relevance condition holds, never as an
always-on body.

### Managed-source root checks

Each `_refuse_managed_source` call loads configuration anew and resolves each
unique declared admin/workspace root once through `_comparable_root`. The local
results serve only that call's overlap and containment checks. Later calls
revalidate configuration and link targets; no authorization is cached across
requests or turns. Candidate paths remain lexical until the existing path gate
admits them, and rejected UNC roots are never resolved. Every admin-overlap and
managed-memory exclusion remains in force.

### Reproduce essential-context wire measurements

`test/test_essential_delivery.py` keeps the fresh-plus-20-warm receipt assertions
in the normal suite. Its companion no-receipt test also runs automatically and
captures the exact submitted strings as JSON, with 21 complete essential
snapshots and one current request per turn. The fake transport replaces only the
external subprocess; context construction and the provider stream run for real.
These are submitted UTF-8 prompt bytes, not model token counts or proof of native
harness ingestion.

For a before/after measurement, run that same capture test in a separate trusted
Git snapshot, then pass its log as `KIROCREW_ESSENTIAL_BASELINE` to the current
receipt test. This variable now names a UTF-8 capture log, **not a Git ref**.
The current interpreter reads JSON data only; it never executes source from the
baseline or replaces loaded modules/classes. All baseline production imports come
from the complete snapshot, not old context code mixed with current providers.

From the current checkout, the following Bash recipe uses an existing interpreter
with the project's test dependencies. Set `PYTHON` to its absolute path and
`BASELINE_SHA` to the full commit SHA of a reviewed, trusted pre-change revision.
A separate checkout/process prevents module mixing, not hostile-code execution;
never use an untrusted revision. No dependency install or live gateway is needed.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${KIROCREW_SCRATCH:?}" "${PYTHON:?}" "${BASELINE_SHA:?}"
root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
sha=$(git rev-parse --verify "${BASELINE_SHA}^{commit}")
[ "$sha" = "$BASELINE_SHA" ]
measurement=$(mktemp -d "$KIROCREW_SCRATCH/wire.XXXXXX")
snapshot="$measurement/snapshot"
mkdir "$snapshot"
git archive --format=tar "$sha" > "$measurement/source.tar"
tar -xf "$measurement/source.tar" -C "$snapshot"
# Copy test instrumentation only; leave all production sources at the baseline.
cp "$root/test/test_essential_delivery.py" "$snapshot/test/"
cp "$root/test/test_member_essential_context.py" "$snapshot/test/"
export PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX="$measurement/pycache"
export TMPDIR="$measurement"
export KIROCREW_HOME="$measurement/home"
export KIRO_HOME="$measurement/kiro"
export KIROCREW_WORKSPACE="$measurement/workspace"
export PYTEST_ADDOPTS=
unset KIROCREW_ESSENTIAL_BASELINE
printf 'BASELINE_COMMIT=%s\n' "$sha" > "$measurement/before.log"
(
  cd "$snapshot"
  PYTHONPATH="$snapshot/src" "$PYTHON" -m pytest -n0 --no-cov -q -s \
    -o addopts= --timeout=60 -p no:cacheprovider \
    --basetemp="$measurement/before-tmp" \
    test/test_essential_delivery.py::test_wire_without_receipt_fresh_and_twenty_warm_turns
) >> "$measurement/before.log" 2>&1
PYTHONPATH="$root/src" KIROCREW_ESSENTIAL_BASELINE="$measurement/before.log" \
  "$PYTHON" -m pytest -n0 --no-cov -q -s -o addopts= --timeout=60 \
  -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp="$measurement/after-tmp" \
  "$root/test/test_essential_delivery.py::test_actual_wire_fresh_and_twenty_unchanged_warm_turns" \
  > "$measurement/after.log" 2>&1
printf 'Reports: %s/before.log %s/after.log\n' "$measurement" "$measurement"
```

The after log prints `BASELINE_BYTES` and `WIRE_BYTES`: fresh bytes, all 20 warm
sizes, total bytes and envelope count. The baseline log retains the commit and
all 21 strings so their byte lengths can be checked independently. Byte totals
include real temporary-path lengths; the envelope-count and content assertions
do not depend on those lengths. Missing, duplicated or incomplete captures fail
rather than silently dropping the baseline. The recipe leaves only session-owned
scratch output for inspection and normal scratch cleanup.

## LLMProvider ABC (`providers/base.py`)

`providers/base.py` is the surface, and it is the only honest copy of it — a
hand-maintained member list here goes stale without anything going red. Read the
module.

The members that carry *contract* meaning, rather than plumbing, are the ones a
harness can get wrong:

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `start` / `shutdown` / `stream` | The turn lifecycle every consumer depends on. |
| `approve_tool` / `reject_tool` | Tool-approval responses; `approve_tool` returns whether an allow answer was sent, and a provider that cannot answer must still refuse, never hang. |
| `context_usage_pct`, `context_usage_unknown`, `context_window_tokens`, `context_used_tokens` | The context meter. `context_usage_unknown` is what distinguishes "0%" from "not measured". |
| `session_id`, `cleanup_session`, `cwd` | Session identity and cleanup routing; a wrong `cwd` persists the wrong workspace on resume. |
| `served_model`, `available_models` | The model actually served, which can differ from the id Crew stored. |
| `maybe_refresh_available_models(catalog_ids)` | Revalidate the advertised snapshot before the model picker narrows the catalog with it. The default returns the current snapshot unchanged; ACP kiro sessions re-probe a suspect snapshot that would hide a row and raise `EntitlementRevalidating` on a deadline miss. `AcpProvider` forwards only when it wraps an `LLMProvider` (the shared-runtime path); on the dedicated `AcpClient` transport it re-probes itself through `AcpClient.refresh_available_models` when a catalog row would drop, rate-limited by `_picker_probe_at` and bounded by the read deadline (raising `EntitlementRevalidating` on a miss). See [model-selection](../common/model-selection.md). |
| `steer` / `supports_steer` / `last_steer_monotonic` | The steer extension. Non-implementers answer `-32601`, so `supports_steer` must be honest. |
| `supports_refusal_steer` | Whether a deny notice steered mid-turn reaches the refused turn's model; gates deny-notice steers. Narrower than `supports_steer`. Default `False`. |
| `steer_needs_loss_recovery` | Whether a steer the provider accepted can still be dropped (codex drops injected text when a later approval is denied or the turn is cancelled); when `True`, `AcpProvider` refuses wrapper steers and only a caller that keeps and requeues the text may steer. Default `False`. |
| `has_active_turn`, `has_unfinished_turn`, `wait_turn_done` | Turn-state probes the session layer reads before reusing a process. |
| `is_session_sharing_eligible` | Whether one process may host multiplexed sessions. |
| `manual_compact_unsupported_backend`, `compaction_self_managed`, `compaction_unmanaged_backend`, `mcp_config_hot_reload`, `uses_kiro_identity_store` | Capability answers, each defaulting to the safe value so a Kiro path never needs a `hasattr` probe (harness-parity H14). The three compaction answers are deliberately separate questions, because a backend Crew cannot hand `/compact` to is one of three things: the harness bounds its own context (`compaction_self_managed`, default `True`), nothing bounds it and Crew recycles (`compaction_unmanaged_backend`, default `None` — the one destructive answer, so it is granted by `ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE` membership and never by exclusion), or nobody has established which, in which case Crew declines and logs the gap. Collapsing them told a deepseek user their harness summarizes on its own, which it does not. |
| `member_capabilities_supported`, `loaded_capability_template` | Full member-spec support defaults to false and is granted only by `ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_CAPABILITIES` membership (harness-parity H6); the observed loaded template defaults to empty. Only a dedicated Kiro runtime with a confirmed active template provides evidence; the session layer also validates the saved version and MCP registration report before showing applied. |
| `billing_stats`, `child_fidelity_aware` | Accounting and subagent-fidelity reporting. |

## LLMEvent (`providers/base.py`)

Provider-agnostic event dataclass (aliased from `AcpEvent`). The table below is
not exhaustive; the `EVENT_*` constants in `acp/types.py` own the kind list:

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text_chunk` | Text output from agent |
| `thinking_chunk` | Extended thinking |
| `tool_call` | Tool invocation |
| `tool_result` | Tool output |
| `permission_request` | Tool approval request (ACP only) |
| `complete` | End of turn |
| `compaction_status` | Compaction result |
| `clear_status` | Clear display |
| `agent_switched` | Agent mode changed |
| `mcp_oauth_request` | MCP server needs OAuth (has `server_name`, `oauth_url`) |
| `mcp_server_initialized` | MCP server ready after OAuth (has `server_name`) |
| `mcp_server_init_failure` | MCP server OAuth/init failed (has `server_name`, `text`) |

Terminal events also carry `synthetic_completion`. It is false for a provider's
raw result frame and true when Kiro Crew fabricates a compatibility terminal
because the result frame never arrived; consumers that account completed work
must require the raw form.

## AcpProvider (`providers/acp.py`)

The ACP provider carries its owning session key through the `session_key`
argument of `AcpRuntime.create_session` and `load_session`. The same key names
the session's broker stubs and passes through the harness's session extras;
KAS uses it when projecting native managed MCP servers on creation and resume.
The key is not read from the agent's editable environment and does not enable
member-DM control tools. Kiro and Codex accept this common harness argument
without adding custom-agent payloads; their session extras remain empty.

For KAS, `start` completes only after the active agent's required
managed MCP servers and tool exposure are ready. A failed or timed-out
initialization surfaces an error before any prompt; it does not return a
tool-less session. The session-scoped barrier and its budget are specified in
[acp-client.md](acp-client.md#kas-managed-mcp-readiness).

The one concrete provider. It spawns a long-lived harness subprocess — by default
`kiro-cli acp --agent <name>` — and speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.

**The backend seam:** `AcpProvider`/`AcpClient` take an `acp_backend` id from
`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`; the empty id denotes kiro-cli. Construction rejects an id
outside that registry, so a value that falls through every identity check cannot
spawn kiro-cli under a foreign label. Which registered ids an operator can select
is the separate, live `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` set in
`agent_sdk/backends.py`, not a duplicated list in this file. Binary resolution and
config isolation per backend live in [`acp-client.md`](acp-client.md); do not add
a second provider or a provider-level selector (see `AGENTS.md`, "Harness parity").

Adding an id to `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` also obliges a frame-replay corpus under
`test/fixtures/acp_frames/<id>/`; the requirement and what it buys are stated once,
in [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md).

**Key APIs:**
- `start()` → `AcpClient.ensure_ready()` (spawns process, handshake, session/new)
- `stream()` → maps events from `stream_events()`; `allow_image=False` makes the turn text-only (see [acp-client](acp-client.md#image-support))
- `stream_command()` → native slash command execution
- `approve_tool()`/`reject_tool()` → JSON-RPC response
- `context_usage_pct()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_pct`
- `context_window_tokens()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_window_tokens` (the real served window from `usage_update.size`, 0 if unknown). Used by the dashboard token text instead of re-deriving the window from the model id. A mid-session `set_model` (live switch on both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionHandle`) rebases these stats via `AcpPromptStats.rebase_to_window`: the window is re-derived from `model_registry.model_window` (0 on a registry miss), `context_used_tokens` is kept, `context_pct` is recomputed and clamped, and `context_tokens_from_usage` is cleared so the next metadata `contextUsagePercentage` can backfill against the NEW model instead of being gated forever by the old model's `usage_update`. The dashboard model-switch endpoint then broadcasts one `context_usage` WS event with `reset: true` (both live-switch and session-reset paths, single and bulk), which lets the frontend reducer replace or delete its stored per-slot token counts — per-turn events without `reset` never delete. The post-compaction pct-0 broadcast carries the same flag.
- `compact()` → sends `/compact` via `send_command()`. The **dashboard's** manual `/compact` gates on `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` first, as a pre-acquisition local command: the live session's `manual_compact_unsupported_backend` capability property (declared on the `LLMProvider` ABC with a `None` (supported) default per harness-parity H14, answered by the ACP implementations from set membership) is peeked when a session exists, else the same `agent.acp_backend` config the factory would build one with — so a refused `/compact` behaves as if the turn never started (no session created, no Slack OPTIONS expired, no one-shot turn state consumed). The reply is informational — the backend manages compaction automatically, mirroring the `cc_managed` relationship — not an error: kiro-cli answers the prompt with `_kiro.dev/compaction/status`, claude-agent-acp compacts natively in-prompt, and codex-acp intercepts the prompt as the `compact` command it advertises and reports the compaction as a `tool_call` pair marked `_meta.contextCompaction` (`_dispatch.parse_codex_compaction_update`), but KAS treats the prompt as ordinary text and never emits a status, so an ungated manual `/compact` would strand `wait_for_compaction()` for the full `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (#7800). The **auto-compact** path consults the same capability from the compaction gate ladder (`session_compaction._compact_unsupported_backend`) and then takes one of THREE arms, because a backend it cannot dispatch to is not one thing. A member of `ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_MANAGED_COMPACTION` (KAS) declines with `"compact_unsupported"` before the compaction task is scheduled, so no `/compact` is dispatched and the turn semaphore is never acquired — an ungated dispatch stranded the status wait for the whole `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` while HOLDING that semaphore and then recycled the session (#7812) — and declining costs nothing there because its `summarization_completed` frame resets the meter. A member of `ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE` (deepseek) is **recycled** instead, via `_recycle_unmanaged`: no compaction reaches it from either side, so a decline bounds nothing and its context grows into the harness's own window. That arm falls THROUGH the decline rung rather than returning from it, so `unconfirmed`, `in_progress` and `cooldown` still run first — an ambiguous reading must not spend a recycle. A backend in NEITHER set declines and is logged at WARNING naming the missing membership, because ending a conversation is not something a harness earns by never having been classified; `compaction_self_managed` is what tells that case apart from KAS's. The callback reports which arm ran (`compacted` / `recycled` / `restarted_uncompactable` / `cancelled`, plus `waiting_for_subagents` during a hold) so a surface cannot announce a summary that never happened, and only `restarted_uncompactable` may say the backend cannot compact — a kiro-cli session whose in-place `/compact` merely timed out reaches `recycled`. `cancelled` means a user Stop ended the compaction: the cooldown is armed and the session is not recycled. Every context restart — a failed in-place `/compact` and an uncompactable restart alike — is first HELD while session-sharing sub-agents still run on the parent's process, because shutting that process down would end them unreported (`CompactionCoordinator._await_cotenants`): the callback reports `waiting_for_subagents` with `success=False`, the hold re-checks every `cotenant_poll_secs` (the manager's per-key completion event is shared, so another waiter may release it), and past `cotenant_wait_secs` only those runs are stopped with the ordinary per-run `SubagentManager.cancel`, bounded and shielded, so each still reports "stopped" into the conversation, which carries on after the restart (the parent-end helper would mark them out of delivery). A user Stop during the hold ends it: the stale restart is abandoned, the sub-agents are not stopped, and the compaction settles `cancelled` (cooldown, no recycle). Channel messages queued behind the held turn are not dropped with the old session: `CompactionCoordinator._restart_held` starts the successor first (past the recycling marker, holding its lease), moves the old session's live queue into the successor's real queue, then recycles the old one and wakes each entry's channel drain before releasing the lease, so queue verbs, teardowns and ordering behave as for any queue. Slack registers a drain for this (`_drain_slack_queue`). If the successor cannot start, the old session, its queue and its resume id are kept and the failure cooldown applies. A report that waits on the parent during the hold cannot reach the old process: every waiting acquire re-validates the session's identity, so it lands on the fresh session. The **messaging-surface** `/compact` commands (Slack, Telegram, Discord, Webex, Teams, Feishu, iMessage, WeCom, Weixin and WhatsApp) gate on the same capability through `messaging.commands.compact_unsupported_backend` before dispatching, answering with `compact_unsupported_reply` (translated on the Chinese-language surfaces, plain-voiced on iMessage and WhatsApp); their context-threshold notices decline silently on such a backend — no forced hard-threshold compaction to run, and no soft nudge whose `/compact` advice cannot work (#8156) — with one exception: a member of `ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE` is WARNED once, before its session is restarted, with a message that offers `/new` instead (`messaging.commands.context_recycle_warning`, `context_recycle_warning_zh` on the Chinese surfaces). That warning is keyed to the session's live `session.autocompact_pct` rather than the channel's `soft_threshold_pct` — it fires in `[threshold - CONTEXT_WARN_MARGIN_PCT, threshold)` (`recycle_warning_due`), because the channel soft default (80) sits above the recycle default (70) and a warning keyed to it would land after the restart — and the per-conversation latch is cleared outside that band so the next fill after a restart warns again (#11948). Gating covers only command dispatch — KAS auto-summarization frames keep mapping to compaction status.
- Dashboard manual `/compact` while conversation-history replay is still pending (the replay lease is armed and the provider session holds nothing yet): it answers at once with `COMPACT_REPLAY_PENDING_NOTICE` ("Nothing to compact yet: the restored history is delivered with your next message."), awaits no compaction status, does not re-arm skills context, and leaves the replay lease armed for the next prompt.

**Reasoning effort** (Opus/Sonnet/Fable **and GPT-5.x** — shared vocabulary in `effort.py`: levels `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, resolution via `resolve_effort_for_model` with priority slot-override > workspace default > None). Capability authority is per harness. For kiro and claude the registry answers (`model_supports_effort`). For members of `ACP_BACKENDS_EFFORT_FROM_ADVERTISED_OPTION` (pi) the session's advertised config option answers both `supports_effort` and the allowed levels: `_resolve_effort` passes `levels=` (the advertised list) and `normalize=` (`effort_config_option_value`, the backend's spelling of a level) to `resolve_effort_for_model`, so the fold runs before the advertised-list filter and before the write. The registry capability is a conservative allowlist of known-capable families (`opus`/`sonnet`/`fable`/`gpt`, minus a hard `haiku` exclusion), verified against kiro-cli 2.12/2.13 over ACP — kiro rejects `/effort` on the other third-party models (deepseek/minimax/glm/qwen/auto) with "Effort configuration is currently not available on <model>". A new model family lands as unsupported until confirmed (safe default: the slider hides). Applied via a workspace `cli.json` overlay at `<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json` → `chat.modelDefaults.<model>.<key>.effort`, projected before every spawn by `_apply_effort_overlay`: the session's own resolved level is written (`_write_cli_overlay`) together with its exact-match provenance in the flat top-level `kirocrew.effortOwned` map; when none resolves, `_clear_cli_overlay_effort` removes the model's entry only if that in-file record names the exact active-key value still present. The record counts only while the sibling `kirocrew.effortOwnedStamp` equals the whole-second mtime of the `cli.json` the reader loaded (`effort_ownership_stamp_matches` in `workspace_cli_settings.py`). Every Kiro Crew writer of the file (the ACP effort writer, the skill projection's `carry_effort_ownership` carry-through, and Sage's review overlay) stamps a staged file that carries the record with an even second at least three seconds back before its rename, so the record and the inode that validates it appear together; a document with no record is published with no stamp and a natural mtime. A writer whose document equals the file it read under the lock, apart from the stamp, while that file's record is valid does not write (`owned_document_unchanged`): the file keeps its bytes and its mtime, so the record stays valid and a same-level projection or a Tool Search write before each spawn leaves a committed `cli.json` unmodified. Any rewrite outside those writers voids the record, kiro-cli's own `settings --workspace` writes included: a rewrite that keeps the unknown keys still gives the file a new mtime the stamp does not name, and one that drops them has no record at all. Either way every entry Kiro Crew wrote reads as the operator's: projections stop claiming those values, ownership-guarded clears stop removing them, and a Default or `auto` chat keeps those levels and runs them until someone removes them; that chat's pre-spawn warning names the level. Nothing is deleted. What kiro-cli has to tolerate is therefore two keys it does not know, verified on kiro-cli 2.27.1: `settings list` loads the workspace `chat.modelDefaults` and `toolSearch.*` settings with the `kirocrew.effortOwned` and `kirocrew.effortOwnedStamp` keys present, and a chat spawns and answers the same as in a work dir without it. Whether kiro-cli's own writes keep the key no longer decides anything. The re-check to run after each kiro-cli bump is in [docs/reference/kiro-cli/README.md](../../reference/kiro-cli/README.md), and `test/test_kiro_cli_effort_ownership_pin.py` fails when the bundled `packaging/kiro-cli-version` pin is raised past the verified version without it. An operator-authored entry has no record, and an operator edit (any rewrite outside Kiro Crew's stamping writers) voids the record because the file's mtime no longer equals the stamp, so both survive a Default-session pre-spawn projection and start while stale ownership is dropped. The `auto` branch applies that ownership check to every recorded model. A lock-free `cli.json` existence check comes first, so a directory with no overlay is not given an overlay or lock. Every session in the work dir shares `cli.json`, so it is never read back into `_effort_per_model`: a level in it may belong to another session or the operator, and adopting it would run that level in a session whose slot shows Default. What a session runs comes only from what the factory threads — the slot's persisted level (restored from its saved metadata after a restart), a spawn's request, and configured defaults. The `<key>` sub-object is family-specific (`effort_settings_key`): `output_config` for Claude models and `reasoning` for GPT models. Kiro ignores the wrong key. `_write_cli_overlay` changes only the active key during an automatic projection and preserves an `effort` under the other family key. Ownership-guarded clears use the model's active family key, and explicit clears sweep both keys. The ACP writer is the in-product writer of the ownership record for chat sessions (Sage's review overlay writes its own review entries under the same stamp rule, and the skill projection only carries an existing record through). It takes the shared `.kirocrew-cli-settings.lock` sidecar (see [acp-client](acp-client.md)) and publishes an active-key effort value plus provenance in one atomic `cli.json` write. Ownership is record membership: Kiro Crew owns an active-key effort value only when its `kirocrew.effortOwned` record names that exact non-empty level and the file's `kirocrew.effortOwnedStamp` still equals its mtime. Every other present value (a level the operator set, a JSON `null`, a non-string) is the operator's. An automatic projection keeps it and drops only a stale or malformed record; an ownership-guarded clear leaves it; an unowned value equal to the requested level is kept and never claimed. When no record is stale or malformed the writer leaves the file unchanged. `_clear_cli_overlay_effort` takes the action ceiling by default: an operator action runs it through `asyncio.to_thread` — waiting that long on the loop would freeze every session — and losing the lock there means a stuck holder rather than routine contention. The pre-spawn projection passes the startup ceiling instead, like the pre-spawn write. The WRITE side takes the same action ceiling. `change_effort` applies the overlay off-loop and refuses to push live unless it persisted or it kept an operator-authored value. In the kept-value case the live `/effort` push carries the session's resolved level, and a later fresh session receives the same level through reassertion. `_write_cli_overlay` therefore never returns silently over an existing overlay it could not merge into. This effort writer leaves a `cli.json` that cannot be read (`OSError`) or cannot be parsed into a settings object byte-for-byte unchanged and raises, so the projection reports failure instead of a level the file does not hold. `_write_tool_search_overlay` merges through the same read (`_read_cli_overlay_document`) and refuses the same way, so neither writer ever resets a `cli.json` it could not parse; `_apply_tool_search_overlay` logs the refused write and the session still starts. The pre-spawn overlay writes keep the startup ceiling, and `start()` runs the projection through `asyncio.to_thread` so that ceiling is a real wait: on the loop thread the lock is single-shot, so a session starting while another chat's `change_effort` held the lock across its read and write would, on the loop, give up at once and spawn into the level that chat left. Cancellation of `start()` is delayed until that worker completes, so an abandoned start cannot write after its replacement has projected. A launch can pay a two-second wait, and a launch whose overlay is missing still pushes at spawn. Construction does no effort file I/O. `start()` runs the projection through `asyncio.to_thread` before every spawn. Its answer stays two-valued: a failure that happened by design would need a third state for "nothing changed", and one that means something is wrong does not. Its successful return means the ownership decision completed: a matching Kiro Crew value was removed, or an unowned/operator-edited value was preserved and any stale record was dropped. The explicit `clear_effort` UI path passes `owned_only=False`, because the operator has directly asked to remove this model's entry. When a workspace default resolves, explicit Default removes both family-shape effort entries and projects the workspace default in one locked atomic write, so the old entry is never published absent the replacement; a non-object `chat.modelDefaults`, or a non-object entry or effort object for that model, refuses the rewrite and leaves `cli.json` byte-for-byte unchanged rather than discarding operator data. Automatic clears retain the ownership guard, keep an operator-authored entry, and push the resolved workspace default live. An ownership-guarded removal emits one bounded, escaped info line naming the changed `cli.json` file and removed `model=level` pairs; if a level was set by hand to the same value, set it again after the removal. An absent file or entry and a `cli.json` that cannot be parsed into a settings object are successful no-ops that leave the file's bytes unchanged; a malformed ownership map owns nothing, while a lock failure and a read that fails on a file that exists under the held lock return failure. `clear_effort` answers that case with a THIRD outcome (`None`), not a bool: both bool values make the handler commit the cleared slot value — the reset branch before its teardown, and the success path before its final 200 — so either would show "default" over an overlay that still holds the level, and `False` additionally resets into re-reading that same level. `None` means nothing changed on either side, and the handler answers it with a 409 `effort_overlay_busy` that commits nothing and resets nothing. Its message lists the causes: a held lock, which a retry outlasts, or a file that is a link or in a folder that leaves the work dir or sits on a sensitive path, unreadable, not a JSON object, holding a non-object setting for that model, or past the 1 MiB read ceiling, which must be fixed first. `change_effort` has no such case: it raises, because a change that did not persist is a failure rather than a no-op. Clearing to a resolvable workspace default runs under the same write-first discipline: it applies the overlay off-loop under the action ceiling and pushes `/effort` only once that landed, because a live push over a write that did not persist reports a default the next spawn replaces with the level just cleared — a failed write there restores the popped override and answers `None` as well. `clear_effort` must not report a clear on that answer — the level is still on disk and the respawn a reset asks for would meet the same held lock, so it would spawn into that level. It restores the popped entry and logs a warning naming the model, and returns True — not False: the handler resets the session on False, and that reset would re-read the same level, so the operator would pay a reset and still run the old effort. True here means "no reset needed", which is the true answer when nothing changed on either side; the warning is what asks for a retry. The `change_effort` rollback path restores the level the same way for the same reason, in both of its shapes: the one that clears an overlay its live push never applied, and the one that rewrites the overlay back to the prior level. When either write loses the lock the file keeps the attempted level — the level the session was asked to run — so the map follows the FILE, the next spawn projects it back, and a warning names the level a respawn adopts: reporting an undo the file does not show would be worse than admitting the rollback is incomplete. Live change pushes `/effort` with the TuiCommand args form (`send_command(args={"level": …})`). The factory threads `reasoning_effort_override` → `effort_per_model[current_model]`, keyed by the configured spelling; on the claude client path `start` moves that entry to the model the session records after `ensure_ready` (claude records the advertised spelling, e.g. `claude-opus-5-5[1m]` for a `claude-opus-5.5` pin), and leaves it in place when every spelling was refused and the session runs the backend default. For an advertised-option harness the factory carries the level forward and leaves judgement to `_resolve_effort` once `session/new` has advertised the option, so a cold start does not drop it on the registry's answer. Otherwise, when a valid requested effort cannot be threaded on a cold start (the resolved model is empty or not effort-capable) the factory's gate logs one warning naming the level, the session, and the resolved model (or `auto` when unresolved, matching the spawn-side `effort_dropped` verdict) — reporting its own drop decision on surfaces that construct a fresh provider, an explicit `reasoning_effort_override` always warns (a caller's own dropped request is the event the gate exists to surface), while a drop sourced only from the config default (`agent.reasoning_effort`) is deduped once per (model, level) for the factory's lifetime so one static configuration fact does not repeat on every construction. A `reasoning_effort_override` on a warm-pool claim is applied post-claim via `provider.change_effort` (updating `_effort_per_model` and the `cli.json` overlay write) rather than bypassing the pool, recovering pool-hit startup latency; if the claimed model does not support effort, `change_effort` returns False and a corresponding drop warning is logged. The dashboard handler routes through `change_effort`/`clear_effort` and only resets the session when there is no live provider. Non-effort-capable models persist the slot value without a live apply or reset.

An `auto` session checks every Kiro Crew ownership record in one locked pass before spawn. It removes only an effort value that still exactly matches its record, preserves unowned or operator-edited values, and drops stale records. Its concrete model is not known until after kiro-cli reads the overlay, so every recorded model must be considered. The lock-free existence check remains the first step, so an empty work directory gets neither an overlay nor a lock.

The overlay is still one file per work directory. Inside one gateway, a spawn that leaves its model at the model default holds a work-directory fence from its projection until its kiro-cli has read the file, so no level can land in that window: no chat's pick, no live Default clear that writes a workspace default and no other session's level projection. Spawns that leave their model at the default share the window because each only clears. A Default-branch spawn waits for a write already in progress, and while it waits blocks new writes so it cannot be overtaken by one. It waits through the longest file-lock wait plus the startup-lock margin; if that bound expires, the start fails instead of reading a file a gateway write could still change. A pick that meets the fence waits, up to the same ceiling it already waits for the file's lock, and then takes the same answer a held lock gives it. The fence is in-process and its end point is the whole runtime start, because which protocol step reads the file is not established: a second gateway on the same work directory, kiro-cli's own `settings --workspace` write, Code Review Sage and a hand edit are not held by it, and a level one of those writes between the projection and the read is still run by that session until its next spawn, because kiro-cli has no live "model default" to push. Closing that part needs a per-session overlay or effort carried in `session/new`, which is outside this PR.

A level written by an older build has no `kirocrew.effortOwned` record and survives automatic clears. An explicit Default removes it for a concrete model that takes effort. On a live session the clear does it at once, and when its `/effort` push fails after the rewrite it asks for a reset instead, since the file already holds the default; otherwise (no live session, a turn in flight, a clear that raised, a model without effort) the key's session-map entry carries the one-shot `explicit_effort_default` flag, and the key's first cold start skips the warm pool and removes that model's entry, or swaps it for a Kiro Crew default level, before spawning. The removal waits for that start because the start, not the pick, resolves the work directory and the model whose entry it removes, and a workspace switch, a cleared project or a model switch can change either after the pick. Every explicit Default that rewrites the file, live or at that start, does it inside a warm-pool fence: no warm runtime is claimed while the write is in progress, each one queued before the write settled is refused at its claim, and one claimed before the write began is discarded before its session is registered, because each may have read the removed entry at its own spawn. A start or live clear cancelled during the write lowers the fence only once the write has settled, and the start still records whether its replacement ran. That start clears the flag once its projection succeeds, so an `auto` session or a model without effort clears it after removing nothing, as the live clear removes nothing for them; a start that cannot rewrite the file leaves the flag for the next one. The pick saves the flag before it answers. A cold start reserves that flag in memory without changing it on disk, arms the provider, and clears and saves the flag only after the projection reports that it applied the Default. A kill before that clear is saved leaves the flag armed, so the next cold start applies the Default again. The replay normally finds the entry already gone; a level written by hand between the killed start and the next one is replaced, just as one written between the pick and the first start is. A start whose projection does not apply writes nothing and leaves the durable flag armed. A failed or cancelled start does the same unless its projection already applied, in which case it clears the flag in memory without awaiting so the map's deferred flush still owes the clear. A failed save after an applied projection does not fail the start: the in-memory flag remains clear and the map's next save retries it. While a key's cold start is in flight, from its read of the flag until the session is registered, a pick on that key that would change the flag is refused with the retryable 409 a turn in flight gives (`turn_in_flight`) and changes nothing, so no pick can change the basis a start publishes on; a level pick on a key whose flag is already clear has nothing to record and lands, because the reservation is also held while a caller waits to claim the key's live session, which can last a whole turn; a pick that already reached the live session keeps that session's value and reports the unsaved intent as before. A pick that passed that check before the start took its reservation may still be saving its flag when the start reaches its read; the start then waits for that save to settle, so it reads either the saved value or the one a failed save put back, never a value no save kept. The write is counted under the session's canonical key, so the two spellings of one Slack thread share it. A level that cleared a pending Default before its push still puts it back when the pick does not commit, even while such a start is in flight, and the next cold start applies it. A pick whose flag cannot be saved is refused with 503 before anything changes, unless its level already reached the live session, which it then reports with a warning. A pick refused after the flag was saved puts the earlier choice back, and says so with a warning when that save fails. A level clears a pending flag before it is pushed to a live session, so that clear is saved before anything else changes, and every exit that does not leave the slot on the level puts the flag back. After a rebind during the switch, a pick the slot's new binding cannot save is refused the same way, after any session its push reached is back on the slot's value; when that session cannot be put back, the pick is kept and reported with a warning. The session map holds the flag for at most 1,000 sessions, each key at most 200 characters, and a pick it cannot hold is refused with the same 503. A pick that clears a session's flag keeps that row counted until it ends, so putting the flag back is never refused and no other session's pick can take the row meanwhile. A level `session_set_model` committed at the turn start clears a pending flag in the same step, and the turn saves it before acquiring a session; a later effort-picker choice on any slot driving that session that changes its explicit-Default flag (a Default pick, or a level pick that clears a pending Default) bumps every open slot driving the session and supersedes the call's effort half. A level pick with no Default pending does not. A failed or cancelled save puts the pick, the slot's values and the flag back, so the turn runs on the values it had and the next turn applies the pick again. A start on a level its caller chose runs that level and leaves a pending flag as it found it, neither arming nor clearing it: the level is not a newer effort action on the key (a level pick through the effort handler, or a level `session_set_model` commits at the turn start, clears the flag itself) but a slot's level read before the Default pick landed, an alias slot's own level, or a caller's pin, and the key's next start without an override applies and clears the flag. Such a start still takes the warm pool, where its level is pushed after the claim. The reader refuses a `cli.json` past a 1 MiB ceiling, a link, a hardlink, a non-regular file, or a file that escapes the canonical workspace settings directory: a write raises and leaves it unchanged, a clear returns failure, and a Default or `auto` spawn logs that it may run another session's level. The settings lock also refuses a settings folder on the sensitive-path list, or one whose real path cannot be verified, before it creates or opens anything beneath it, with the same outcomes; skill projection and Code Review Sage take that lock too. The reader also refuses a `cli.json` whose opened descriptor names a sensitive file or cannot be resolved. Where descriptor-relative writes are supported, the read and publish use the settings directory the lock opened, so a folder replaced or linked after the lock cannot receive the write and the writer raises. Elsewhere both use the by-name floor, so such a swap is not caught. The settings folder the lock opens is resolved component by component beneath the trusted work directory. Each `.kiro` or `settings` name is inspected with `lstat`; a link or junction is expanded from `readlink` text only. Relative and absolute targets are admitted only when their lexical path stays inside the resolved work directory. A remote, outside, rooted-on-another-drive, or looping target is refused without opening, resolving, or probing that target. A clear or Default in such a work directory reports that it could not change `cli.json`, whether or not the named target contains that file. The directories from the work dir down to an admitted folder are then walked by the names that admission produced and never through a link (`O_NOFOLLOW` per component on POSIX; create, pin and re-check each level on the by-name floor), so a part swapped for a link after admission is refused, as is a second admission that differs from the first. The lock file and the `cli.json` leaf are never followed, and every consumer takes the folder from the lock (`LockedCliSettings.settings_dir`), so an accepted link reads and writes the same folder it locked. The in-process spawn fence uses that same admitted folder as its key. When admission refuses a link, the fence key uses the resolved work directory plus the literal `.kiro/settings` names and never resolves the refused link. If the work directory itself cannot be resolved, the start fails rather than running under a different key from another chat in that work directory. Two work dirs sharing an admitted settings folder therefore exclude each other. The pre-spawn projection warns once, collecting bounded samples of escaped file-derived model names and values, listing at most 10 entries and then the count of remaining entries, when a Default or `auto` spawn may run such an unowned level instead of the model's default. To remove it, pick a concrete level in the effort picker and then pick Default, or hand-edit `cli.json`; an `auto` slot has to select the listed model first, and its warning says so; a slot already showing Default returns before the clear path.

**MCP Tool Search** (kiro-family backends — see https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/mcp/tool-search/): loads MCP tool specs on demand ("search-and-call") instead of sending every tool definition each turn, keeping the context window clear when many MCP servers are configured. Gated by the `agent.tool_search` config toggle (default **on**; auto-surfaces as a Settings toggle since the schema is generated from the dataclass).
- **kiro-cli (Rust engine):** applied via the **same** workspace `cli.json` overlay used for effort (`<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json`), written deterministically before every spawn and on each restart by `_write_tool_search_overlay` (called from `AcpProvider.start()`), scoped to `ACP_BACKENDS_TOOL_SEARCH_OVERLAY`. The engine activates deferral only when the agent's `tools` also grants `tool_search`, so on this channel the loader invariant is the engine's. When enabled it writes the flat keys `toolSearch.enabled=true` plus `toolSearch.minPct`/`toolSearch.minTokens`, taken from `agent.tool_search_min_pct` / `agent.tool_search_min_tokens` (defaults `5` / `50000`, mirroring kiro-cli's own thresholds; clamped to 0-100 and >= 0, non-numeric falls back to the default); when disabled it writes `toolSearch.enabled=false` and drops both thresholds.
- **Why the thresholds are not forced to 0:** deferral costs a round-trip — a deferred tool's spec is absent from the model's tool list, so the first direct call fails with `A tool with the name '<name>' does not exist` and has to be recovered with `tool_search`. That only pays once the specs are genuinely large, which is what the thresholds express (kiro-cli defers when EITHER is exceeded). Setting both to `0` restores unconditional deferral for operators who want it. The thresholds are always written **explicitly** rather than omitted, so a value already in the file is replaced rather than silently kept.
- Writing both `true` and `false` makes the Kiro Crew toggle authoritative over any value in the user's global `~/.kiro/settings/cli.json`. The write is merge-safe with the effort `chat.modelDefaults` keys in the same file. A `cli.json` that cannot be read (`OSError`) or cannot be parsed into a settings object is left byte-for-byte unchanged and the write raises; the provider logs the skipped write at WARNING and starts the session without it, so a corrupt overlay costs that spawn its Tool Search projection, never the operator's file or the session.
- **KAS:** never opens `cli.json`; it reads the setting from the ACP `initialize` request, `clientCapabilities._meta.kiro.settings.toolSearch` — a process-wide channel filled by `AcpRuntime._handshake_client_capabilities`, entered from the spawn path only when the harness answers `client_meta_settings` (the harnesses in `ACP_BACKENDS_CLIENT_META_SETTINGS`; every other host reads its constant with no new step), from the same `agent.tool_search*` values (`agent_sdk/tool_search.py`). KAS defers **every** MCP spec when told to and does not check that a loader is mounted, so the client keeps the invariant: `enabled` is sent as `true` only when the spawn agent's spec grants `tool_search` — named in `tools`, or via `"*"` / `@builtin` — and does not take it back in `excludedTools`; it is sent as an explicit `false` otherwise — never omitted, so a host default cannot flip a session into "deferred, unreachable". The spec judged is the one the KAS projection puts on the wire (`AcpRuntime._projected_spawn_spec`: the freshness gate's snapshot for a derived agent, else `load_agent_spec` on the user-level agents directory after the same `ensure_agent_materialized` self-heal the projection runs) — never a project checkout's `.kiro/agents` spec, which that projection does not consult; an unreadable spec grants nothing. The setting is process-wide, so every later `create_session` on a deferral-enabled process judges the payload it is about to send: a projection that grants no loader — another agent, or the same agent whose spec has since lost the grant — is refused with `AcpToolSurfaceBindingError` (an `AcpWorkspaceBindingError`), which the run-runtime caller already answers by giving that session a runtime of its own. The check lives in `AcpRuntime._kas_custom_agents`, the projection seam both `create_session` and `load_session` go through, so a resumed session is judged the same way. It is deliberately one-directional: a process whose handshake sent `enabled: false` may serve a later session whose agent does grant the loader — that session simply runs with full tool specs, today's behaviour and never a loss of tools — whereas the reverse pairing loses every MCP tool, which is the only shape worth a refusal. Every KAS-capable runtime constructor threads the same resolved settings — the foreground provider, its resume-respawn fallback, the companion-runtime kwargs mirror (`session_allocation._collect_parent_runtime_kwargs`, reading the parent's `LLMProvider.tool_search_settings` capability — default `None`, answered by `AcpProvider`; harness-parity H14) and the background runtime (`session_background`) — so no KAS process is left to the host's default. KAS does not honour the two thresholds as an activation floor — deferral there is all-or-nothing, with `toolSearch.neverDefer` as its keep-list — but they are forwarded verbatim so the setting means one thing.
- **Non-kiro-family backends** — no-op on both channels. `_apply_tool_search_overlay` returns early when the backend does not read the overlay, the handshake channel is filled only for members of `ACP_BACKENDS_CLIENT_META_SETTINGS`, and both are silent when no toggle value was threaded in (`tool_search is None`).
- **Native-resume compatibility:** for a direct dashboard turn with Tool Search enabled (dashboard session identity and no resumable linked-channel identity), the kiro backend does not use `session/load`. Before provider acquisition, dashboard chat resolves the slot's dedicated Slack field unconditionally and uses the channel-neutral `SessionMap.mirror` link only when `mirror_accepts_inbound` is true. Thus inbound-capable Telegram/Discord links remain distinguishable when they reuse a `dashboard:*` key after restart, while outbound-only iMessage/WhatsApp mirrors still take the direct-dashboard recovery path. A loaded transcript can return without Tool Search's activated schemas: `tool_search` reports a match, but the next inference still cannot invoke that tool. The provider instead creates a fresh native session and sets `_history_replay_needed`, so `SessionManager` marks conversation replay pending against the rebuilt tool registry. That decision is the pure module-level `resume_takes_tool_search_replay` in `agent_sdk/tool_search.py` — below both callers, because the dashboard may not import the ACP layer (`scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`) — (Tool Search on, `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO`, no channel identity, a key `telemetry_channel_of` classifies as `dashboard`) — the ONE definition, read by `_start_kiro_runtime_impl` once a resume sid is in hand and by the dashboard's resume prefetch (`chat_runner._eager_spawn`) BEFORE any runtime exists: a speculative load the provider replaces this way can only come back `resumed=False` and be refused after a full spawn and teardown, so the prefetch logs `left to first turn (tool-search replay)` and spawns nothing, and the first real turn takes the fresh-session path described here. Only this direct-dashboard compatibility branch also makes `defer_replay_sid_promotion` true; `SessionMap` keeps the prior full-history SID durable while that lease is pending, allocation does not publish the fresh SID yet, and `close_all()` refuses to overwrite the retained mapping while `provider_switch_replay` remains armed. Generic `session/load` recovery still requests history replay but publishes its fresh SID immediately because non-dashboard dispatchers do not own the dashboard settlement contract; a later channel restart therefore resumes the recovered native transcript rather than the stale pre-recovery SID. Replay settlement runs from the dashboard turn's `finally`, so exceptions, task cancellation, early returns, and synthetic terminals cannot bypass it. A landed, non-synthetic replay-bearing `end_turn` promotes the fresh SID, as does confirmed `/clear` after native history deletion. Cancellation, incomplete streams, and every other non-committed terminal leave the prior SID in place and re-arm replay, so a second gateway restart cannot strand a slash-only or discarded transcript. That lease drives every replayable dashboard session-start prompt block (history, ContextBuilder, member context, folder, persona, and context telemetry). `AgentSpawn` hooks remain keyed to the actual provider spawn so script side effects execute once; a slash-first turn does not re-fire them during replay. Non-destructive native slash commands bypass `ContextBuilder` and leave the lease intact; a confirmed `/clear` consumes it at `EVENT_CLEAR_STATUS` so later replay cannot restore deleted history. Authorization, shutdown, or pre-dispatch Stop aborts preserve it. Async stream creation is not acceptance: a replay-bearing non-slash turn records acceptance in runner-local state only when its stream yields the first provider event, while the shared lease remains armed throughout the in-flight turn. Empty streams and pre-output failures therefore retain replay without settlement, and a concurrent shutdown can observe only the still-pending old SID. Final settlement synchronously promotes the fresh SID and consumes the lease only for a landed, non-synthetic, non-empty `end_turn`; every empty-response verdict is unlanded for replay durability, including the terminal give-up rung when retry budget is exhausted or auto-continue is disabled. If an accepted turn ends cancelled, the still-armed lease carries forward because kiro-cli discards that turn; the next prompt receives the full older replay plus its cancelled-turn preamble. This trades the native resume latency win for a usable dashboard tool surface without losing prior conversation or undoing an explicit clear. Setting `agent.tool_search=false` keeps dashboard-native `session/load`; a dashboard-keyed resumable channel turn and every channel dispatcher remain on native resume regardless of Tool Search.

- **Resume guard:** `session/load` (resume) is only attempted when Tool Search is disabled and the prior session transcript exists on disk (`~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<sid>.json`). A stale persisted sid with no transcript falls back to `session/new`, preventing a fresh conversation from replaying old turns (which inflated base context).
- **Working dir:** `AcpProvider.cwd` overrides the `LLMProvider` ABC default so `session_map` persists the real workspace path. AcpProvider's work_dir lives on the inner client (`_client._work_dir`), so a consumer reading `_work_dir` off the provider gets `""` for every ACP session; `provider.cwd` is the member to read. It reports the directory THIS session was bound to, not the runtime's: `AcpRuntime` records `bound_cwd` on the `AcpSessionHandle` at `session/new` and `session/load`, `AcpSessionProvider.cwd` reads it off the handle, and `AcpProvider.cwd` forwards that, falling back to `_client._work_dir` only before startup, on a raw `AcpClient`, or for a handle with no recorded directory. A shared runtime hosts sessions opened against different projects, so the runtime's own directory would make reuse validation evict a live session that bound elsewhere.

## Config (`config/loader.py`)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "acp",
    "model": "auto"
  }
}
```

- `agent.provider` is fixed to `"acp"` (enum `["acp"]`); the provider is not a choice.
- `agent.acp_backend` is the harness choice, resolved through `agent_sdk.backends.resolve_selected_backend` (the top-level `acp_backends` module is a re-export shim kept for existing call sites).
- `create_provider_factory()` returns a `Callable` that builds an `AcpProvider` for the resolved backend.

An agent spec's model is consumed by kiro-cli before Kiro Crew reaches
`session/new`, so the live-session entitlement guard cannot diagnose a wrong
wire spelling at spawn time. Agent create/update validate a pin before
persisting it: they reuse the role-model validator for advertised ids and
`model_registry.acp_id_correction` for the offline positive case where the
registry recognizes a non-ACP spelling and can name its ACP id. Unknown ids are
allowed because they may be valid regional or newly released ids; empty and
`auto` continue to defer. Doctor applies the same correction audit to every
discoverable user- and project-scoped spec.

## MCP Server Registration

MCP servers are passed directly in the `session/new` params. The managed servers
are the entries of `agent.py:_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS` (see also
[`docs/architecture/mcp.md`](../../architecture/mcp.md)): `kirocrew-core` and
`kirocrew-cron` are unconditional, `kirocrew-computer` is spec-gated
(`_computer_use_spec_gate`), and the others (`kirocrew-dashboard`,
`kirocrew-work`, `kirocrew-crew-log`) are opt-in per their entry.
User-configured servers from the agent config are merged in.

## SessionManager (`session.py`)

- Provider-agnostic via factory (one provider, `AcpProvider`, over the resolved backend)
- Calls `repair_agent_configs()` on gateway startup and periodically
- Resume: calls `set_resume_session_id()` before `start()`

### Workflow one-shot session teardown is best-effort

`workflows/agent_pool.py::_run_unpooled` (a `ctx.agent(session=...)` named
call, or the identity-cap overflow valve) tears its session down in a
`finally`: `release(key, cleanup=False)` for a named conversation (the turn
lease is returned, the conversation is kept), `destroy(key)` for a one-shot
`wf-unpooled:` key. That teardown is best-effort: a `release`/`destroy`
exception is caught and dropped so it can never replace the step's real
outcome. A successful result is still returned, and the body's own exception
(a provider failure, a `WorkflowScope.validate()` rejection after the step)
propagates unchanged; `CancelledError` is not caught, so a cancel still
propagates after the teardown attempt. The failure is logged at WARNING with
the exception TYPE only, no message and no `exc_info`, because this logger sits
on the task diagnostics path and a session error's text can carry conversation
content or credentials. Pinned by `test/test_workflows_agent_pool_unpooled_teardown.py`.

### Workflow sessions publish their own turn identity

A workflow worker's kiro-cli process has no ambient `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`
(`AcpRuntime` does not export one). Its eligible managed MCP elements carry an
ordinary signed per-session token, including when the broker is disabled.
Every workflow send surface also calls
`messaging.identity.publish_turn_identity(sessions, key)` at the same point in
the turn as the chat and channel dispatchers: after `get_or_create` returned the
session, before the prompt is built or streamed. `_WorkflowSessionWorker.send_message`
publishes per turn (a hard reset respawns the process, so the pid can change) and
`_run_unpooled` publishes for a named `session=` chain and for the identity-cap
overflow session. The key published is always the worker's own
(`wf-pool:{run}:{n}`, `wf-unpooled:{run}:{n}`, the named key, or the
`WorkflowScope.worker_key` hash), never the parent chat's. The writer keeps its
fail-safe contract: a session without a pid, or a fake without `get_pid`,
skips publication and never fails the turn. Pinned by
`test/test_workflow_memory_backend_reset.py::test_workflow_worker_publishes_identity_before_mcp_http`
(real child transport) and `::test_unpooled_paths_publish_identity_before_prompt`.

## Subagent Approval Mode Inheritance (`subagent.py`)

Subagents inherit the global `approval_mode=auto` config as a final fallback when:
1. No parent session key exists (spawned independently), OR
2. Parent session key exists but the session is no longer in the store (garbage-collected)

If the parent session is alive but returned no policy, deny-by-default applies — the session is intentionally non-auto. This ensures subagents spawned from dashboard sessions still get auto-approval even if the parent session is GC'd before the subagent executes.

## Automatic recovery

Provider-level recovery mechanisms that fire automatically without user intervention:

**Interactive transient-5xx retry:** the interactive dashboard/Slack `chat_runner` stream loop retries a transient backend 5xx (InternalServerError / DispatchFailure / ConnectionReset, JSON-RPC `-32603`) through the shared `llm_helpers` transient classifier + backoff, **without** resetting the still-alive session. Auth/validation errors are excluded (fail-fast); on retry-budget exhaustion a clean error surfaces on a still-resumable session. The unattended `stream_and_collect` path uses the same classifier, but its same-model and fallback-chain retries replay the original prompt only while no assistant text or tool call has occurred across any attempt. Any fired tool call makes a later transient error terminal on that path, including when the tool completed without producing text.

A transient 5xx that arrives *after* the turn already emitted output (the `_turn_emitted` guard is set once any assistant token streams or a tool call fires) does not drop the turn: it **RECOVERS ONCE**: the streamed partial is preserved as a finalized assistant message, a brief recovery notice is appended, and a *continue* instruction (not the original prompt) is re-queued onto the SAME live ACP session — which still holds the interrupted turn's context (original prompt, streamed partial, and any completed tool results) — so the model resumes from where it stopped rather than restarting. The recovery is one-shot per genuine user turn: the allowance is consumed only when a recovery is actually enqueued and is refreshed at the start of the next real user turn, never on the synthetic recovery turn, so a repeated post-token 5xx during recovery surfaces a clean error instead of looping. When Stop is active or the turn is nested (`_prompt_depth != 0`) the partial + notice are still shown but nothing is re-queued (the allowance is left unconsumed). This recovery **also applies to turns that already fired a tool call** — an ACCEPTED TRADEOFF (owner decision), rather than failing fast: a mid-stream 5xx is rare, and the continue instruction tells the model to resume and not re-run tools that already completed. A residual double-execution risk remains only for a side-effecting/destructive tool that was still *in flight* when the 5xx hit; the owner accepts that narrow risk in favor of recovering the turn.

**Compaction-failure notice backoff** (dashboard-chat; `dashboard/chat_utils._broadcast_compaction_result`): repeated per-turn compaction failures are collapsed rather than repeated. Per slot, `_compaction_fail_streak` counts consecutive failures and the first `_COMPACTION_NOTICE_SHOW_FIRST_N` (=2) are shown verbatim ("❌ Compaction failed: …"); further failures within the `_COMPACTION_FAIL_COOLDOWN_SECS` (60s) `_compaction_fail_cooldown_until` window are suppressed, and when the cooldown elapses a single collapsed "failed Nx in a row … Consider `/compact` manually" message is shown with `/compact` guidance. A `completed` status resets the streak/cooldown. `acp/client.py:_handle_compaction_status` logs the raw failed-compaction notification params at WARNING (kiro-cli carries no dedicated error field on failure). The reason a failed notice shows comes from ONE reader, `acp/transport_errors.compaction_failure_detail` — a ranked walk of the payload's reason-bearing keys, redacted and capped, falling back to the raw payload shape when none is named — so the notice and the retry verdict (`compaction_failure_is_transient`) read the same view of the frame. The streaming dispatch loops (`AcpClient`, `AcpSessionHandle` and its KAS `summarization_failed` branch) put that reason in the event's `title`, and both `wait_for_compaction()` implementations (`AcpClient` and `AcpSessionHandle`; `AcpProvider` and `AcpSessionProvider` pass the result through) put it in the result's `summary` when the notification's own `summary` is empty — kiro-cli populates `summary` on success but leaves it empty (or `null`) on failure, which otherwise left the manual `/compact` notice at a bare "Compaction failed." while the automatic one named the cause. A `failed` notification whose `summary` is non-empty is returned as-is (redacted), a `completed` result is unchanged, and a payload naming no reason yields the reader's own fallback text ("no reason reported by the agent (raw: …)") on both paths. This is a UX/spam guard only — the underlying compaction still runs every turn on kiro-cli's schedule — and is distinct from SessionManager's proactive auto-compact cooldown.

**Compaction resets — then accurately re-reports — the context meter**: a `completed` `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` drops the stale token stats at the provider chokepoints — `AcpClient._handle_compaction_status` (every dispatch loop plus `wait_for_compaction`) and the mirrored sites in `AcpSessionHandle` (prompt dispatch loop and its `wait_for_compaction` queue-drain path) — via `AcpPromptStats.reset_after_compaction()`: `context_used_tokens`/`context_pct` zero out and `context_tokens_from_usage` clears (so fresh metadata can re-derive instead of being gated by the pre-compaction `usage_update`), while `context_window_tokens` is kept (the model did not change, so the served window still holds). kiro-cli then emits a fresh `_kiro.dev/metadata` with the real post-compaction `contextUsagePercentage` about a second after the completed status (live-probe confirmed), so `wait_for_compaction` grace-drains up to `_POST_COMPACTION_METADATA_GRACE_SECS` (5s) for it on `AcpClient`, `AcpSessionHandle`, and `AcpProvider`'s cached mid-turn result path (which delegates to the inner client via the `AcpSessionProvider` pass-through); the drain only ends on a metadata frame actually carrying a `contextUsagePercentage` (a credits-only frame is consumed but does not end it), re-queues non-metadata frames before any poison sentinel, and lets process death (`AcpError`) propagate; `_backfill_context_window` prefers the **kept served window** over the model registry when deriving tokens from that percentage, since the served size can differ from the static entry (e.g. opus served at [1m] vs a 200K registry row). The dashboard's manual `/compact` path then broadcasts the REAL post-compaction numbers when the drain captured them, and only falls back to `context_usage {pct: 0, reset: true}` (the same contract as the threshold auto-compact callback and the in-turn `_broadcast_compaction_result` chokepoint) when no metadata arrived — the meter then self-corrects on the next turn's telemetry. A failed/timed-out compaction leaves the counts untouched and re-sends them as-is. `_context_usage_payload` treats `used == 0` with a known window as "not measured yet" and omits the token fields, so the unconditional end-of-turn broadcast cannot overwrite a reset with a false "0 / W tokens" claim.

## Installation

Kiro Crew drives `kiro-cli` over ACP — install it per its own docs, ensure it is
on `PATH`, and run `kiro-cli login`. `kirocrew doctor` reports its status.


## AcpProvider: shared-runtime startup

`AcpProvider.start()` branches on the backend. Every shared-runtime branch below
enters the same `AcpRuntime.spawn()` cold-start coordinator (default 2 concurrent
spawn+initialize handshakes per gateway loop); admission is backend-neutral, so an
adapted runtime harness neither bypasses the bound nor changes the Kiro path.

- **A runtime backend (`is_acp_runtime_backend`, i.e. membership in
  `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` — kiro, KAS and codex)** → `_start_kiro_runtime()`.
  This spawns an `AcpRuntime` (carrying the provider's sandbox mode, extra env,
  and MCP-gateway overlay/socket), resumes via `runtime.load_session()` when a
  prior transcript exists or otherwise `runtime.create_session()`, applies the
  configured model, and replaces `self._client` with an `AcpSessionProvider`
  (which implements the same interface as `AcpClient`, so downstream callers are
  unchanged). Any failure after `spawn()` kills the runtime so a half-initialised
  session never leaks an orphaned `kiro-cli`.

  This path builds a mirrored host's MCP array through that host's mirror.
  `AcpRuntime._mirrored_session_mcp` answers `None` for a backend with no mirror
  (`providers.mirrors.registry.has_mirror`), so kiro and KAS keep the pooled path
  they always had — byte-identical, no new conditional and no new failure mode on
  the shared construction path (harness-parity H13). For a mirrored backend it
  resolves the broker stubs, mints this session's stub token onto them, and hands
  them to `mirror.session_projection(...)` as `stub_elements` so ONE owner narrows
  both halves of the array: a stub carries the same `name` as the spec entry it
  rewrites, so appending stubs after a projection withheld that name would re-add
  the server as the unrestricted one of the two. `session_key` and `channel_id`
  ride the elements because a codex stdio server starts from `env_clear()` plus an
  allowlist and can learn its session no other way. `permission_surface_owned` is
  False: this runtime authors no native permission file, so a mirror in claude's
  class fails closed here rather than delivering tools Crew's gate cannot see. The
  harness still narrows transports afterwards (`session_mcp_servers`), which is
  the last word on what this session's handshake advertised.

  Two things come out of the projection that are not wire data. The per-tool deny
  set lands on `AcpSessionHandle.spec_denied_tools`, and
  `AcpSessionHandle._deny_spec_disabled_tool` refuses those calls at
  `session/request_permission` — before the event is yielded, so no consumer
  auto-approve and no human is asked to re-decide what the spec settled. It reads
  the call's identity through the same `_dispatch.identified_mcp_call` the
  `AcpClient` path reads, so the restriction cannot hold on one transport and not
  the other. The derived-spec snapshot the array was built from is re-checked once
  `session/new` / `session/load` returns
  (`AcpRuntime._require_unchanged_mirrored_spec`): for a mirrored host the array
  IS the derived spec, so a spec write landing between the build and the host
  consuming it ends the session instead of running restrictions nobody agreed to.
- **A non-runtime backend (not a member)** → `AcpClient.ensure_ready()`, one
  process per session with no shared runtime. The branch is expressed as
  positive membership, not `not is_claude_backend`, so a harness added later
  does not inherit the kiro-family path (harness-parity H5).

`AcpProvider.is_acp_runtime_backend` reads `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` directly.
There is no indirection function and no env switch in front of it, so the
FOREGROUND start path and the background path (`session._bg_runtime_backends`)
read the same frozenset — background narrows it further with
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION`, for the reason given in `session.md`,
"Multiplexed _bg runtime". Two sites narrow by that set, not one: warm pooled
reuse (`AcpSessionProvider.new_conversation`) reads it for the same reason from
the other direction — running on the shared runtime is what makes a resident
session possible, and only an evicting teardown makes reusing one cheap rather
than cumulative.

That predicate answers ONLY the transport question: which start path a session
takes. It does **not** answer who reads the kiro-family workspace `cli.json`
overlay. Codex runs on the shared runtime, reads no such file, and takes effort
over `session/set_config_option`, so the two sites that keyed overlay work off
the runtime predicate key off `ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_SLASH_COMMANDS` instead — the
set that owns that question (harness-parity H6). A harness author looking for
"the one gate" is looking at the frozensets themselves; `harness_for()` serves a
host whether or not a capability set names it.

**A provider switch on codex is process-wide, not per session.** codex-acp's
`providers/set` restarts the shared `codex app-server`: it waits on every active
prompt, stops every session's async tasks, restarts the child, then resumes each
session individually — and a per-session resume can FAIL while the restart as a
whole reports success. On a per-session adapter the blast radius is the one user
who asked for the change; on the shared runtime it is every session on that
process, so one chat's provider change is a liveness event for all the others.
Nothing sends `providers/set` per session, and nothing should start.

`AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible` is membership in
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING` (harness-parity H6), not `not is_claude_backend`:
a capability granted by the absence of one backend is inherited by every backend
added later. It is what `SessionManager.is_session_sharing_eligible()` consults
to decide whether a parent session can host multiplexed subagent sessions. Kiro
and codex are the members.

Membership is about the PERSISTED THREAD, not about a session that stays alive.
Teardown still sends the disposing verb on both members — a subagent session left
resident on the shared process after its parent ends would hold its own MCP fleet
on a runtime nobody is using — and `spawn_continue` re-reaches the conversation by
loading the record the host kept: kiro-cli's transcript under
`<kiro home>/sessions/cli`, or the thread `codex` persists under `CODEX_HOME`. So
the question membership answers is: after this backend's teardown verb, can a
`session/load` still restore the thread?

Codex answers yes, measured on codex-acp 1.11.0 against codex 0.154.0:
`session/close` evicts (the sessionId stops answering), a `session/load` on that
closed id succeeds and the session then answers a question about the first turn,
and the same load succeeds from a RESTARTED adapter process over the same
`CODEX_HOME` — which is the shape a continuation actually takes, since the runtime
that served the subagent is usually gone. `session/delete` archives the thread and
a load afterwards refuses, so release has a verb that genuinely disposes and
`close` is not it. `ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_OWNED_SESSIONS` is what carries the
restore: codex resolves a load from the sessionId alone.

KAS answers no, and that is the whole of its exclusion: `_kiro/session/delete`
REMOVES the persisted record, so there is nothing for a load to restore and a
shared subagent would strand `spawn_continue` on `conversation_gone`. A different
gap, owned by whoever gives KAS a non-destroying teardown. The invariants governing what an
added harness may and may not change are in
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md).

Native Kiro CLI spawning also prepares a bounded skill discovery view, shared by
the direct client and runtime. Its workspace settings suppress implicit native skill
inheritance; authored mappings stay available to Crew scoped search/list/read.
See [ACP client](acp-client.md#native-skill-startup-views).

### Codex dashboard session mount

For an agent explicitly granted `kirocrew-dashboard`, the Codex mirror rebuilds
its direct launch from the gateway-managed entry and injects that session's
identity. Both creation and resume use this projection. The Codex harness sets
`DISABLE_MCP_CONFIG_FILTERING=true`: codex-acp otherwise drops a session entry
when global Codex configuration declares the same name, leaving an unbound
server in place of the verified mount. Spec-selected launchers
never receive that identity. Disabled, ungranted and per-tool-restricted dashboard
servers remain withheld. A granted gateway broker stub is also admitted through
the same restriction checks; gatewayd verifies its claim and supplies per-call
identity to the managed backend.

On an enforced sandbox, credential-bearing host readers need the broker route:
configure `mcp_gateway.stub_servers` to include `kirocrew-core` and
`kirocrew-dashboard`. Direct children cannot read the gateway credential or SEL
trust root there; the Codex dashboard mount does not relax those masks. Global Codex MCP entries
are not a substitute for this session mount.
