# Kiro CLI Documentation

Offline mirror of the `kiro-cli` documentation. Nothing constrains the CLI to a
particular line at runtime. `acp/client.py` finds the binary with
`kiro_cli.resolve_kiro_cli`: the `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` override first, then the
desktop app's bundled directory, the known install directories, and the
inherited `PATH`. Unattended spawns use `kiro_cli.pin_kiro_cli`, which drops the
inherited `PATH` and accepts only an absolute path. `kiro_prerequisite.py`'s
`KIRO_CLI_UPDATE_COMMAND` is an unversioned `kiro-cli update`. The version
numbers in the code are feature floors, each a lowest probed release rather than
a supported range, and a 3.x CLI satisfies all of them: `mcp_hot_reload.py`'s
`MCP_HOT_RELOAD_MIN_KIRO_CLI_VERSION` (2.21.0, MCP hot reload) and
`kiro_cli.py`'s `SPEC_PERMISSIONS_MIN_VERSION` (2.23.0, the agent-spec
`permissions` block) and `MANDATORY_MCPS_DROP_MIN_VERSION` (2.27.0, deferring
Crew's MCP servers under Tool Search).
None of these floors is effort-related: the `kirocrew.effortOwned` ownership
record in the workspace `cli.json` counts only while its sibling
`kirocrew.effortOwnedStamp` equals the file's whole-second mtime, so it depends
on kiro-cli tolerating two keys it does not know when it loads workspace
settings, verified on kiro-cli 2.27.1. The one tripwire is
`test/test_kiro_cli_effort_ownership_pin.py`, which fails when the BUNDLED pin in
`packaging/kiro-cli-version` is raised past that verified version; a `kiro-cli`
the host installed itself is not covered by it. After a kiro-cli bump, re-verify two things
on the new version. First, kiro-cli still loads a workspace `cli.json` carrying
the `kirocrew.effortOwned` and `kirocrew.effortOwnedStamp` keys (`settings list`
shows the workspace `chat.modelDefaults`, and a chat spawns and answers), and
after a `kiro-cli settings --workspace` write the file's whole-second mtime no
longer equals the recorded stamp, so Kiro Crew's readers treat the record as void
instead of claiming the rewritten entries. Whether that write keeps or drops the
two keys does not matter; a write that left the stamp equal to the new mtime
would. Second, a live `/effort <level>` push still sets the
session's effort: kiro-cli's next `_kiro.dev/metadata` notification reports that
level, under `reasoning.effort` on kiro-cli 2.27.1. That push is how a chat keeps
its own level over a shared overlay that holds another one, and kiro-cli 2.27.1's
ACP command list marks `/effort` deprecated. If the push does not land, move every
`/effort` sender to kiro-cli's replacement channel before the bump ships. Then raise
`EFFORT_OWNERSHIP_VERIFIED_KIRO_CLI` in that test and update the
verified-version note in `docs/system-specs/modules/providers.md`.
So these pages describe what upstream published on the fetch date recorded per
row, not a supported-version contract.

**Upstream is now on the CLI 3.0 line, and reorganised its information
architecture again.** Feature pages that were CLI-scoped are now
surface-agnostic: `/docs/cli/installation/` became
`/docs/getting-started/installation/`, `/docs/cli/custom-agents/**` became
`/docs/custom-agents/**`, `/docs/cli/mcp/**` became `/docs/mcp/**`,
`/docs/cli/reference/slash-commands/` became `/docs/reference/slash-commands/`,
`/docs/cli/chat/model-selection/` was replaced by `/docs/models/**`, and
`/docs/cli/chat/subagents/` moved to `/docs/custom-agents/subagents/`. Genuinely
CLI-specific pages — `/docs/cli/chat/`, `/docs/cli/acp/`,
`/docs/cli/autocomplete/` — stayed put. Upstream keeps the 2.x formats at
`/docs/cli/2x-reference/`. The Source column below records the path each page is
fetched from and when. Every page also carries the same pair on its own first
lines.

Every mirrored page has a Markdown twin at the same path with a `.md` suffix, so
`/docs/skills/` is fetchable as `/docs/skills.md`. Use that for a re-fetch: it
returns the page without the site's navigation chrome. `https://kiro.dev/llms.txt`
indexes every page and is the fastest way to find where one moved to.

Two pages are **local, not mirrored**, and the tree's do-not-author rule does not
reach them — [`../README.md`](../README.md) names the exception mechanism:

- `chat/voice.md` — Kiro Crew's own voice setup, with no upstream counterpart.
- `mcp/oauth-token-storage.md` — derived from the `aws/amazon-q-developer-cli`
  source and Kiro Crew's current `mcp_grant.py` / Connections implementation, not
  from a published storage reference.

`acp.md`, `hooks.md` and `steering.md` carry local additions on top of mirrored
content; each is marked in the page. A re-fetch must preserve them.
