"""docs-lint — keep the documentation trees navigable and their indexes honest.

Stdlib only, no third-party deps, cross-platform. Run from the repo root::

    python3 scripts/docs_lint.py             # lint
    python3 scripts/docs_lint.py --test      # self-test the checks themselves
    python3 scripts/docs_lint.py --update-baseline   # prune the fact-check baseline

Exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = findings, exit 2 = usage/environment error.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
Documentation rots in three specific ways that a human reviewer reliably misses
and a machine catches for free:

1. **Dangling links.** A doc is moved or merged and the links pointing at it are
   never updated, so the reader hits a 404 on GitHub.
2. **Unreachable docs.** A file is added but never linked from its directory
   index, so nobody (human or AI) finds it and it silently goes stale.
3. **Phantom specs.** Code and comments cite a spec path that does not exist —
   the reference reads as authoritative while pointing at nothing. This repo
   accumulated several such citations, including a "frozen contract" module
   whose spec and conformance-gate docs were never ported.
4. **Stale line citations.** A doc points at ``session.py:3356`` of a file that
   now has 2520 lines. Source moves every day and the citation does not, so it
   sends the reader to nothing while reading as precise — and when it overshoots
   the end of the file it is usually because the code moved to another module
   entirely, which is the part the doc most needs to say.
5. **Phantom code.** A module spec names a source file that exists nowhere. The
   spec claims to describe code that is there now, so an unresolvable path is
   either a rename it missed or a dependency that left the tree — one of these
   was still explaining why the editor uses Monaco, which had been deleted
   outright. Checked only in ``docs/system-specs/modules/``: an RFC or a
   migration design names files precisely BECAUSE they do not exist yet.

Checks 1-5 are the structural invariants behind the repository rule that a code
change must also update the docs and the indexes. The rule is only real if a
machine enforces it.

The sixth check guards the other direction: some documentation filenames are an
API. ``src/kiro_crew/docs/*.md`` is packaged and read at runtime, and specific
filenames are hardcoded in Python and TypeScript. Renaming one of those without
updating its consumers breaks a shipped feature rather than a link.

The seventh keeps bare invariant IDs honest. A harness comment such as ``# H6:``
or ``(H13)`` must name a row in ``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md``.
Otherwise a comment can claim an enforcement contract its owning spec never
defines.

The fact checks, and why they need a baseline
--------------------------------------------
The checks above hold at zero, so they fail outright. A second family asks a
harder question -- is this sentence still TRUE of the code? -- and the honest
answer on a repository this size is "mostly, with a recorded backlog":

* ``path-exists`` -- a backticked repo-anchored source path (``src/**.py``,
  ``scripts/*.py|.sh``, ``website/src/**.ts|.tsx``, ``.github/workflows/*.yml``,
  ``docs/**/*.md``) must name a file. Unlike the suffix-matched citation check
  this one is anchored: the path is written from the repo root, so it either
  resolves or it is wrong.
* ``line-ref`` -- ``file.py:NNN`` anywhere in prose. The beyond-EOF check catches
  the citation that has already rotted; this one catches the citation that is
  ABOUT to, because every line number rots on the next refactor. Cite a symbol.
* ``fenced-path`` -- the same path question inside fenced blocks, for the two
  token shapes a reader COPIES rather than reads: a ``docs/task-specs/...md``
  path and the argument of ``kirocrew run``.
* ``table-row-merge`` -- two index rows glued onto one physical line. Both links
  are present, so every link-graph check stays green while the table renders one
  row short and one file loses its entry entirely.
* ``code-coupled-completeness`` -- the inverse of ``CODE_COUPLED_DOCS``: a
  packaged doc named in a string literal under ``website/src`` and absent from
  that table is an unrecorded coupling, so the pair can be broken silently.
* ``dead-identifier`` -- a backticked identifier that appears nowhere in the code
  trees. Report-only unless ``--strict-identifiers``, because the class is
  genuinely noisy: a doc may name a wire field, a vendor symbol or a deliberately
  wrong example.

Every fact-check finding is a ``(check-id, path, token)`` triple, and the triples
already present when the family shipped live in ``.github/docs-lint-baseline.txt``.
A baselined triple passes; a new one fails. Two operations touch that file and they
are deliberately different verbs: ``--update-baseline`` intersects and can therefore
only DELETE lines, and ``--accept-new`` is the one path that adds, which prints every
triple it records so the exemption lands in a diff a reviewer reads. A MISSING
baseline is an error, not an empty set -- read as empty, one ``rm`` plus one refresh
would accept every current violation forever. Same rule, and the same reason, as
``scripts/check_black_formatting.py``.

A triple that no longer fires is reported but does not fail. That is a concession to
this repository's doc trees being consolidated by several changes at once, so an
entry graduates in a file the current change never touched -- not a claim that a
triple is fragile, since ``FactFinding.key`` omits the line number so a reflow keeps
the same identity.

    """A line number a doc cites must be inside the file it names.

    ``check_code_citations`` guards code -> docs. This guards docs -> code, which
    rots faster and more quietly: source moves every day, and a doc that says
    "see ``session.py:3356``" of a 2520-line file sends the reader to nothing while
    reading as precise. Exactly one claim here is decidable without judgement --
    the cited line exists -- and that is the whole check.

    A citation is matched as a path SUFFIX against the files that exist, because a
    doc cites relative to whatever root its reader stands in: the package
    (``acp/types.py``), the repo (``scripts/x.py``), the website bundle
    (``apps/builtinRegistry.ts``, really under ``website/src/``), an app's own root
    (``providers/pagerduty.py``) or a skill's (``scripts/reaper.sh``). Those roots
    cannot be enumerated. Several matches is normal and not a finding: ``app.json``
    is a real filename in two dozen builtin apps, and the citation is wrong only
    when the line is past the end of EVERY candidate.

    Two neighbouring checks were built, measured against the real tree, and left
    OUT -- recorded here so nobody re-adds one believing it was merely forgotten.

    An unresolvable PATH is reported too, but ONLY from a module spec, and that
    scope is the whole design rather than a convenience. Five narrowings were
    measured against the real tree, and each one that keyed on the path's SHAPE
    left a different family of false positives behind:

    ======================================  =======  ====  =====
    rule                                    findings real  false
    ======================================  =======  ====  =====
    raw                                        1960     -      -
    + require the parent directory to exist      48     -      -
    + suffix match from any root                637     -      -
    + require a directory component              78     -      -
    scoped to ``docs/system-specs/modules/``     41    20     21
    ======================================  =======  ====  =====

    What separates a stale citation from a correct unresolvable one is not the
    path's shape but what the DOCUMENT IS FOR. An RFC, a plan and a migration
    design name files precisely because they do not exist -- ``browser/setup.py``
    sits in a "what is deleted" table, ``notifications/bridge.py`` beside the words
    "zero implementation code exists" -- and an app-kit guide names files in the
    READER's project. A module spec describes code that is there now, so a path it
    cannot resolve is rot. A shape-based allowlist provably cannot draw that line:
    silencing those four deletion-table entries needs ``browser/**``, and the same
    pattern suppresses four real findings.

    The 21 residuals inside the scope were each traced to the code that BUILDS the
    path, and they are exact refs in :data:`_UNRESOLVABLE_REF_OK` rather than
    patterns, so a new unresolvable path is reported instead of absorbed. Two of
    them turned out to be resolver bugs rather than exemptions -- ``site/`` and
    ``docs/`` were missing from the scanned trees, and ``site/package-lock.json``
    is git-tracked, so an exact-ref entry there would have silenced rot on a live
    file forever. Those became trees.

    A cited SYMBOL is still not checked, and the reason is structural. A table row
    pairs independent columns -- ``docs/architecture/mcp.md`` lists a server, its
    entry point ``mcp_computer.py``, and its tool names, which really live in
    ``computer_use/cli.py`` -- so same-line adjacency is not a claim about where a
    name is defined. Dropping adjacency to ask only "does this identifier exist
    anywhere" flags every name an RFC proposes: 572 repo-wide, ~100 in one RFC.

    A check whose findings are mostly false trains a maintainer to skim past the
    gate, which costs more than the gap it closes.

    A cited SYMBOL is not checked either. A table row pairs independent columns --
    ``docs/architecture/mcp.md`` lists a server, its entry point
    ``mcp_computer.py``, and its tool names, which really live in
    ``computer_use/cli.py`` -- so same-line adjacency is not a claim about where a
    name is defined. Dropping adjacency to ask only "does this identifier exist
    anywhere" flags every name an RFC proposes: 572 hits repo-wide, ~100 in one
    RFC, nearly all correct writing about code that does not exist yet.

    Both gaps are the same judgement: a check whose findings are mostly false
    trains a maintainer to skim past the gate, which costs more than the gap.

    The line check is honest about its own reach too -- it catches a citation
    pointing PAST the end of a file, never one that has drifted to the wrong line
    inside it. That is the argument for citing a symbol NAME wherever a doc can: a
    name survives the refactor that moves the line.
