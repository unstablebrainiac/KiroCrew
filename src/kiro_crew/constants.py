# (``session_pid.py``) reads it back from ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` to positively
# identify escaped MCP launcher processes whose *cmdline* carries no KiroCrew

# kill of a user's own identically-named processes. Constant by design: it must

# this tree was spawned as TOOL work rather than as a session leader Kiro Crew owns
# and tears down. ``session_pid._env_is_sandbox_tool`` reads it back out of the
# kernel's exec-time copy, which lets the runtime reconciler leave such a tree out of
# its kill-candidate population on evidence a same-uid process cannot forge on
# another process, where an argv0 basename is merely a name.
#
# It is a claim about the TREE, not about each process in it. The chokepoint has
# callers whose argv0 is itself a managed harness -- a pod child probe, an unattended
# fix-authoring agent -- and the marker is inherited, so a harness can carry it
# without being tool work. The reconciler therefore pairs this marker with the
# managed-argv test and excludes only a pid that is marked AND is not a harness.

# ── Canonical "[OPTIONS: a | b | c]" trailer parsers ────────────────────────
# The agent emits a trailing ``[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | ...]`` marker that
# every surface renders as tappable choices. Two variants exist because the
# surfaces scan differently, but their GRAMMAR must stay identical — so both are
# defined here ONCE and imported everywhere: a hand-mirrored copy risks a
# one-character slip that flips the flag semantics or reintroduces the ReDoS
# class below on a single surface.
#
# Body: a TEMPERED greedy repetition. No alternative in it may consume a ``[``
# that begins a fresh ``[OPTIONS:`` — both bracket forms carry that guard. This
# matters for ReDoS (py/polynomial-redos): a plain greedy ``.*`` body can itself
# consume a ``[`` that also starts the outer ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so over
# untrusted text with many ``[OPTIONS:`` prefixes ``search()``/``findall()``
# re-explore the body from each position — polynomial backtracking. The tempered
# body is unambiguous (linear) while still capturing an inner ``[`` inside an
# option ("Fix [x] logging", "a[1]"). A CLOSER is admitted CONDITIONALLY, not
# freely: only where an earlier ``[`` in the same label matches it or the label
# list continues after it (see :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES` for why
# an unconditional ``]`` made the body run past the marker and delete prose).
# This parser runs over untrusted LLM/relayed text before Slack, the dashboard,
# Discord, Telegram, and WeCom render it.
#
# LINE (``re.MULTILINE``, ``$`` anchor) — for Slack/dashboard, where the marker
# ends a LINE (not necessarily the whole message). The negated class EXCLUDES
# ``\n`` (``[^[\n]``): in Python ``re`` a negated class matches ``\n`` regardless
# of DOTALL, so ``[^[]`` here would silently widen the single-line body to span
# lines (deleting/splitting a multi-line span the old single-line ``.*`` never
# matched). Trailing class is ``[ \t]`` (NOT ``\s``, which under MULTILINE would
# also match ``\n``).
#
# OPTIONAL MARKDOWN-LINK CLOSE ``(?:\(...\))?`` after the ``]``: models sometimes
# append a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` (or any ``(...)``) right after the marker, e.g.
# ``[OPTIONS: A | B | C](OPTIONS)``. That does TWO bad things at once: the extra
# text after ``]`` breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed, AND
# ``[label](url)`` is valid Markdown so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a
# clickable link instead of buttons. Absorbing a single tightly-attached ``(...)``
# here (it stays OUTSIDE the captured label group, so choices are unaffected)
# makes the parser resilient to that tic. The ``(`` must follow the ``]`` with no
# gap, so genuine trailing prose (``] and then...``) or a spaced note (``] (note)``)
# still fails the anchor and is left intact — the deliberate "trailing note on the
# same line" behaviour is preserved. The inner class is ``[^\s()]`` (NOT ``[^)\n]``)
# so it shares NO character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` — that keeps the added group
# unambiguous and avoids a polynomial-ReDoS (``py/polynomial-redos``) backtracking
# path over ``[OPTIONS:`` + a long whitespace run. The real tic (``(OPTIONS)``, a
# bare ``(url)``) contains no whitespace or nested parens, so nothing is lost.
#: Closing brackets accepted on a protocol marker. ASCII ``]`` is the only form
#: the prompt ever specifies, but a model intermittently substitutes a fullwidth
#: or CJK lookalike — U+3011 ``】`` is the observed one; U+FF3D ``］`` and U+3015
#: ``〕`` are the same class of slip. A single wrong codepoint otherwise breaks
#: the end anchor, so the whole marker leaks into the visible message as literal
#: text and the turn silently loses its follow-up pills. Label content is
#: unaffected either way, so accepting the lookalike costs nothing.
#:
#: ONE definition, shared by both regexes below. Deliberately NOT used by
#: :func:`split_trailing_protocol_suffix`'s unfinished-marker check, which stays
#: ASCII-only on purpose -- see the comment there. That asymmetry is the point:
#: completeness is decided by the trailer regex, not by whether some closer
#: character happens to appear in the tail.
#:
#: Each closer is PAIRED POSITIONALLY with an opener in :data:`MARKER_OPENERS`,
#: so ``[`` <-> ``]``, ``【`` <-> ``】``, ``［`` <-> ``］``, ``〔`` <-> ``〕``. The
#: matched-pair body form (:data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR`) emits one alternative per
#: pair, and each alternative closes on ITS OWN closer only, so a ``【`` interior
#: is ended by ``】`` and never by ``]`` -- a mismatched pair (``【 ... ]``) has
#: no pair parse and falls through to the unmatched-opener refusal, exactly as a
#: bare ``[`` with a stray ``]`` does.
#:
#: ReDoS profile is the same as a bare literal ``\]``. The class shares
#: no character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*``, and the body excludes
#: every closer from its negated class and readmits them in exactly TWO places,
#: both of which a widening of this constant has to be re-audited against: as the
#: closing atom of :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR` (one closer per pair) and via
#: :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES` (the full class). Those two are what the
#: disjointness argument is about (see :data:`_MARKER_BODY_LINE`), so the pair
#: form -- which is where the deciding lookahead lives -- is the one NOT to skip.
MARKER_CLOSERS = "]\u3011\uff3d\u3015"
_MARKER_CLOSE_CLASS = "[" + re.escape(MARKER_CLOSERS) + "]"

#: Opening brackets accepted on a protocol marker, PAIRED POSITIONALLY with
#: :data:`MARKER_CLOSERS`: ``[`` opens ``]``, ``【`` (U+3010) opens ``】``, ``［``
#: (U+FF3B) opens ``］``, ``〔`` (U+3014) opens ``〕``. The prompt only ever
#: specifies ASCII ``[``/``]``, but a model that substitutes a lookalike CLOSER
#: substitutes the lookalike OPENER with it, emitting a whole ``【 ... 】`` pair;
#: a matched-pair form that opened only on ``[`` reads that pair's closer as
#: unmatched and declines the marker, so the pills are lost. Opening on the
#: paired lookalike makes ``[OPTIONS: 【x】 | Skip]`` parse exactly as
#: ``[OPTIONS: [x] | Skip]`` does.
#:
#: The two strings MUST stay the same length and order -- :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR`
#: zips them into per-pair alternatives, so a positional edit to one requires the
#: matching edit to the other. Only ``[`` can begin a fresh ``[OPTIONS:`` head, so
#: only its alternative can widen the body past a nested head; the ``(?!OPTIONS:)``
#: guard rides every opener regardless (a no-op on the lookalikes, which cannot

#: before it succeeds or fails -- so a run of the same opener (an LLM

#: lands AFTER the closer, breaks the end anchor, and the marker leaks into the
#: visible message as literal text while the turn silently loses its pills --
#: the same class of model tic as the stray ``](OPTIONS)`` suffix the grammar
#: already absorbs. Scope is deliberately tight so real prose never matches:
#: a LEADING wrapper is accepted only at line start (after optional indent), so
#: emphasis belonging to preceding prose (``**Choose:** [OPTIONS: ...]``) is
#: never eaten, and a TRAILING wrapper only when the marker itself OPENED one:
#: the ``(?(lwrap)...)`` conditional arms only when the ``lwrap`` group
#: captured a nonempty line-leading run. This is the invariant that makes every
#: reviewed corruption shape unreachable at once (mid-line code span
#: ``\`Use [OPTIONS: A | B]\```, a streaming frame's stray run, a MULTILINE
#: emphasis closer ``**Choose one\n[OPTIONS: A | B]**``): a run at line start
#: can only OPEN emphasis under CommonMark flanking rules (preceded by a
#: newline, it is not right-flanking), while a run after the closer can only
#: CLOSE something -- and if the marker did not open it, it belongs to the
#: enclosing prose and must survive the strip. A bare or mid-line marker keeps
#: the pre-widening grammar exactly. Leading-only stays absorbed (nothing
#: follows the closer, so nothing can be stolen); trailing-only does not
#: match and renders literally, as it did before the widening. Runs are capped
#: at 3 (``***`` is the longest CommonMark emphasis run; 4+ is not a wrapper).
#:
#: ReDoS profile unchanged: the class shares no character with the trailing
#: ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*`` or the indent class, and both wrapper positions are
#: anchored by the required ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so no new ambiguity exists.

#: A closer may stay INSIDE a label only where it CONTINUES the label list
#: A label may legitimately carry a closer -- ``[OPTIONS: Alpha ] |

#: UNCONDITIONALLY (the old ``[^[\n]``, which includes ``]``) made the body run to
#: the LAST closer in range instead of the first plausible one, so an ordinary
#: final line that mentions a bracket after the marker matched across BOTH:
#:
#:     Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]
#:
#: matched whole, and since every consumer removes the whole match -- ``slack.
#: format`` and ``messaging.renderer`` cut the visible text at ``match.start()``,
#: and ``whatsapp.turn_renderer`` PERSISTS the cut turn -- the sentence vanished
#: from the message and came back as a pill label. Under TRAILER (``DOTALL``) the
#: body crossed blank lines too, so the whole final paragraph went with it.
#:
#: This is the SAME discriminator the streaming probe already applies
#: (``CONTINUES_LABELS_RE`` in ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/optionMarker.ts``)
#: to decide whether an arriving closer ended the marker, so the regex and the
#: probe now answer that question the same way instead of two different ways.
#:
#: Continuation ALONE is too strict, though: ``[OPTIONS: Fix [x] logging |
#: Skip]`` is a first-class supported shape (pinned by
#: ``test_options_buttons.py`` and ``test_parse_options.py``, whose comments say
#: so outright), and there the closer is followed by an ordinary word. So the
#: body admits a closer under EITHER of two conditions -- it is MATCHED by a
#: ``[`` earlier in the same label (:data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR`), or the list
#: CONTINUES after it (:data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES`). Neither test alone
#: separates the three shapes; the union does:
#:
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix [x] logging | Skip]   matched pair      -> parses
#:     [OPTIONS: Alpha ] | Bravo ]]        list continues    -> parses
#:     Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]   neither      -> declined
#:
#: The two alternatives are made disjoint by what FOLLOWS the closer -- the pair
#: form requires that its closer NOT be followed by a separator or another
#: closer, which is exactly when the continuation form applies. So no span of
#: input ever has two parses, which is what keeps the body linear despite two
#: bracket alternatives (see :data:`_MARKER_BODY_LINE`).
#:
#: RESIDUAL COST. Every shape the union gives up is a closer that satisfies
#: NEITHER half and has ordinary words after it, so at that closer the input is
#: genuinely indistinguishable from "marker ended, prose followed on the same
#: line". There is more than one way to be that closer, and all of them parsed
#: on the old body:
#:
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix ]x logging | Skip]            unmatched -- no opener at all
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix list[dict[str, Any]] now | S] nesting deeper than one level
#:     [OPTIONS: 见【表1] 说明 | 跳过]                a MISMATCHED pair: ``【`` pairs
#:                                                 with ``】``, never with ``]``
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix [multi\nline] now | Skip]     TRAILER only -- the pair
#:                                                 interior excludes ``\n`` even
#:                                                 under DOTALL
#:
#: All four fail toward a VISIBLE marker, not toward deleted prose, and that
#: asymmetry is what makes them affordable: the user sees the marker they were
#: already seeing for the broken shapes, and nothing is removed from the
#: message. A MATCHED lookalike pair (``[OPTIONS: 【x】 | Skip]``) is NOT in this
#: list -- it parses, because :data:`MARKER_OPENERS` pairs ``【`` with ``】``.
#: Making the remaining shapes parse means matching brackets to arbitrary depth,
#: or pairing openers with closers this grammar deliberately keeps unpaired,
#: which a regex is the wrong tool for; the cost is bounded instead by the
#: direction it fails in.
#:
#: A declined marker leaves the text intact only because every partial-cut gate
#: downstream tests for a closer over :data:`MARKER_CLOSERS` rather than ASCII
#: ``]`` -- see the gate in ``messaging.renderer.split_options_trailer``, which
#: this rule is what made load-bearing.
#:
#: NOT reachable by this rule: the separator-tail form (``Done. [OPTIONS: Merge |
#: Wait], details in CHANGELOG[1]``). ``], `` DOES continue the list, by the very
#: rule that makes ``[OPTIONS: Alpha ], Bravo]`` legal, so no guard applied at the
#: INTERNAL closer can tell them apart. What decides that shape is the terminator
#: gate on the bare opener (see :data:`_MARKER_BARE_OPENER_GATE_LINE`), which
#: reaches it from the other end -- the ``[`` of ``CHANGELOG[1]`` is the opener
#: whose partner would end the marker, so the line is declined and left whole.

#: A closer MATCHED by its paired opener earlier in the same label. One level

#: EVERY opener and EVERY closer (:data:`_MARKER_BRACKETS`, so no bracket can be
#: swallowed into the interior and escape the rule, and a run of openers costs
#: one failed attempt each), and it closes on THAT pair's closer alone. Closing on
#: the paired closer only -- not the whole closer class -- is what makes a
#: mismatched pair (``【 ... ]``) decline: no alternative pairs ``【`` with ``]``,
#: so the ``]`` reads as unmatched and the marker falls through to the
#: unmatched-opener refusal, the same outcome a bare ``[`` with a stray ``]``
#: gets. The trailing negative lookahead (the full closer class) is what makes
#: this disjoint from :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES` rather than an alternative
#: spelling of it.
#:
#: Every opener carries the SAME ``(?!OPTIONS:)`` guard as the bare-opener
#: alternative. It is load-bearing on the ``[`` alternative -- without it that
#: form is the one place the union rule is LOOSER than the body it replaced,
#: because it can open on a nested head and pair it with that head's own closer.
#: ``Note [OPTIONS: see [OPTIONS: x] below | Skip]`` then matches from the OUTER
#: head and renders a pill whose label is a raw protocol marker, echoed back as
#: the user's reply when tapped. The guard makes "no bracket form may consume a

#: A marker's labels must have BALANCED brackets.
#:
#: The two patterns above find CANDIDATE markers; this decides which candidates are
#: markers, and it is the whole reason the raw patterns are private. An unmatched
#: opener in the labels means the closer the pattern consumed as the terminator is
#: really that opener's partner -- so the marker was never closed and the candidate
#: is refused.
#:
#: What it prevents: ``[OPTIONS: A | B then check arr[0]``, where the only closer on
#: the line belongs to ``arr[0]``. The body runs on through the prose, that ``]``
#: becomes the terminator, and since every consumer removes the whole match, the
#: line leaves the message and comes back as the pill label ``B then check arr[0``.
#:
#: WHY THE PATTERN CANNOT DO IT. Balance is not a regular language at unbounded
#: depth: a lookahead sees one nesting level, so ``list[dict[str, int]]`` defeats a
#: one-level rule and ``a[b[c[d]]]`` a two-level one. Encoding depths is a
#: treadmill, so the decision lives here and the patterns stay candidates.
#:
#: WHY THE RULE IS TOTAL -- no separator escape hatch. An earlier form accepted an
#: unmatched opener when a ``|`` followed it, on the theory that the opener was then
#: inside a label with the list continuing past it. That hatch was defeated three
#: times, most recently by a ``|`` INSIDE the unmatched bracket
#: (``[OPTIONS: A | B then inspect dict[str | int]``), and each time the shape it
#: readmitted was structurally identical to the shape it was meant to protect. The
#: hatch was the defect, not its spelling.
#:
#: THE COST, which is exactly one shape: ``[OPTIONS: Fix [x logging | Skip]`` -- a
#: label carrying an unclosed ``[`` -- is refused. Admitting it means admitting
#: ``[OPTIONS: A | B then check arr[0]`` too, since both hold one unmatched opener
#: and a closer at the end anchor, and admitting the second deletes a line of prose.
#: A dropped bracket renders the marker as visible text instead, which is the
#: direction every cost in this grammar fails in.
#:
#: An unmatched CLOSER is ignored rather than counted negative: a label may
#: legitimately carry one (``[OPTIONS: Alpha ] | Bravo ]]`` is a supported, tested
#: shape), so it says nothing about the terminator.
#:
#: Openers are TYPED, not fungible. ``【`` pairs with ``】`` and nothing else, so a
#: closer pops only the opener it partners; a closer of another kind is treated
#: exactly like an unmatched closer -- ignored. Counting every closer against every
#: opener admitted ``[OPTIONS: A 【x] | B]``: the ``]`` after ``x`` closed the ``【``
#: on the count, the candidate parsed, and a label with a half-open lookalike pair
#: rendered as options. Under typed pairing that ``【`` is still open at the
#: terminator, which is the bare-opener shape, and the candidate declines.

    The label (:data:`GLUED_FOOTER_TEXT_LABEL`) is inserted on its own line
    between the marker and the moved text; every character of the original
    survives.

    The bug the reflow repairs: a mid-turn steer reply (or any concatenation seam) can
    append prose directly after an ``[OPTIONS: ...]`` line with no separator, so a
    single persisted line reads ``...Pick a path.\\n[OPTIONS: A | B]Anytime.`` The
    render grammar anchors the closer to end-of-line, so the glued line matches
    nothing and the marker leaks as literal text, losing its pills.

    The repair is PURELY ADDITIVE -- it inserts one ``\\n`` and the label line at the
    closer/prose boundary and never deletes a character -- and it runs where the dashboard
    persists a turn's accumulated model text: ``_flush_segment`` for a finished
    segment and ``_persist_partial_reply`` for a turn that ends abnormally. It heals
    text at the moment it is persisted; it does not re-pass already-persisted
    history, and it touches neither the parse grammar nor any of its pinned tests.

    Scope, deliberately narrow:

    * LINE-LEADING with at most three leading spaces. Four-space and tab indentation
      denotes CommonMark indented code, so those samples stay literal. After the
      optional indentation and wrapper the marker starts the line, so a mid-line
      ``Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]`` -- the undecidable case the grammar
      declines on purpose -- is never a candidate.
    * The closer must DIRECTLY abut same-line non-whitespace (``(?=\\S)``). A marker
      that already ends its line is left alone -- including one that ends it with
      the tail the LINE grammar absorbs (a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` tic, a closing
      ``**`` wrapper): the tail is matched atomically, so it is never given back
      to manufacture a glue.
    * An opened wrapper closes on the marker before glue begins. An unclosed
      wrapper places the marker inside a span such as inline code, so the line is
      a sample and not a candidate.
    * A candidate inside a code fence is a SAMPLE the renderer shows verbatim, not
      a footer; it is left alone (:func:`_in_open_fence`, which also answers
      "inside" for an ambiguous fence structure, so doubt means no edit).
    * The marker's VALIDITY is decided by the real grammar's balance check
      (:func:`_marker_labels_have_unmatched_opener`), the same gate
      ``_MarkerMatcher`` applies -- an unbalanced candidate is not reflowed.
    * The trailing remainder must be PLAIN PROSE: it is reflowed only when it
      holds no marker-structural glyph anywhere and does not begin with a second
      stray tic. A tail that overruns the wrapper cap, a repeated ``(OPTIONS)``
      tic, an interior closer, or a label separator all fail toward the visible
      marker. The canonical example ``[OPTIONS: Fix ]x logging | Skip]`` stays
      literal instead of splitting into a false pill.

    Note the merged-turn case (``chatSlice.queueBoundaryFinalize.test.ts``) is a
    FRONTEND-transit artifact: two turns' segments are each flushed through this
    function separately, so a single call here never sees two turns glued. The
    reducer merge happens only when a finalize frame is dropped in transit, which
    is downstream of this seam.

# CONTROL-TAG HTML COMMENTS — canonical grammar (single source of truth).
#
# Agent control tags ride in HTML comments, which the dashboard's markdown
# pipeline renders as nothing (rehype-raw emits comment nodes the react
# renderer skips). Three families exist in ``src/``:
#   * ``<!-- keep-visible -->``       — collapse-all exemption
#   * ``<!-- deliver:<route> -->``    — heartbeat routing
#   * ``<!-- plan_task_id:<id> -->``  — task-planner Apply-to-Tasks anchor
#
# ONE GRAMMAR, TAIL-ANCHORED + FENCE-GUARDED, case-insensitive, both
# recognizers (this regex and ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/
# keepVisibleMarker.ts``): only standalone tag lines at the message tail are
# control tags, and a tail inside an UNTERMINATED fence is visible code (see
# ``_in_open_fence``). Message-tail producers: the prompt rule ("as its
# final line") and the task-planner appender (newline-prefixed). The
# heartbeat's ``deliver:`` tags are HEARTBEAT.md FILE-format suffixes on
# checklist lines, not message-tail emissions — echoed into a message body
# they are mid-body content, which the dashboard renders as nothing and this
# strip deliberately leaves alone. Position-independent stripping was tried
# and retired: rounds 5–8 each surfaced another quoted-code dialect it
# corrupted.
#
# Tag-line leading indent is ≤3 (CommonMark: 4+ spaces renders as an
# indented code block — visible content, never a control tag).
# ReDoS note: every quantifier is BOUNDED (whitespace ≤16, tag body ≤256 —
# generous for real emissions like ``<!-- deliver:dashboard -->``), so a
# failed match attempt does constant work and total matching stays linear
# even on adversarial repetition input (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos: an
# UNBOUNDED body with a failing ``-->`` suffix rescans per start position —
# quadratic). An unterminated ``<!--`` is NOT matched: swallowing to
# end-of-text on a missing ``-->`` silently deletes visible prose. A tag
# body over the bound is not a real control tag and stays visible.

def md_link_destination(char_class: str) -> str:
    """Regex for one unit of a Markdown link destination, the ``HERE`` in ``[label](HERE)``.

    *char_class* is a negated character class for one destination character, and it
    MUST exclude both parentheses (``r"[^()\\s]"``). A unit is one such character or a
    parenthesised run of them, so repeating it (``+`` or ``*``) matches a destination
    whose parentheses come in balanced pairs one level deep.

    That is what CommonMark allows (a destination "includes parentheses only if ...
    they are part of a balanced pair"), and it is the shape real URLs have:
    ``https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)``,
    ``.../ms123401(v=vs.85)``. A ``[^)]+`` destination ends that URL at its first
    ``)`` instead: the link opens a page that does not exist and a stray ``)``
    follows the label. Deeper nesting is left unlinked rather than cut.

    This is the parenthesis grammar of ``messaging.outbound_files._walk_destination``
    bounded to one nesting level. A backslash escape is one token, as it is to the
    walker: a backslash and the destination character after it are consumed as a
    pair, so ``a\\\\)`` closes at that ``)`` where the walker closes, and ``\\[`` is an
    escaped bracket rather than the ``[`` of a nested link. An unescaped backslash
    directly before ``(`` or ``)`` is refused: neither is a destination character, so
    a destination carrying ``\\)`` or ``\\(`` is left unlinked rather than cut at the
    escape. A ``[`` that opens a nested ``[label](`` is refused,
    because that starts a link of its own; this keeps an outer destination from
    swallowing an inner link. Without the refusal ``[x](a [AKIA](u)REST)`` is one link
    to the display-safety screen, which collapses it to ``x`` and scans no key, while
    a CommonMark reader (an unbracketed destination admits no space) links only
    ``[AKIA](u)`` and shows ``AKIAREST`` joined. A ``](`` that opens no link, as in
    ``https://x/a](b)``, stays part of the URL. Wherever the unit matches, it closes
    at the same ``)`` as the walker; otherwise it does not match. Only the destination
    text can differ: the walker drops the backslash of an escaped non-parenthesis
    character as it walks, and ``messaging.outbound_files._finish_destination`` then
    rewrites or rejects what it collected. Neither moves the end: the dropped
    backslash escapes no parenthesis, and the rewrite runs after the close is found.
    It is a regex rather than a call to the walker because four channel renderers
    compose it into one ``re.sub`` pass and the display-safety screen must stay
    linear-time: a walk started from every ``[label](`` opener is quadratic on
    repeated openers. ``test/test_markdown_link_parentheses.py`` pins the shared end.

    Linear on adversarial text: the three alternatives start on disjoint characters
    (a backslash, a *char_class* character other than a backslash, ``(``), and the
    escape is two characters wide. The nested-opener lookahead is not fixed-width,
    but it scans only to the next bracket or newline, so the lookaheads of one
    attempt never cover the same text twice. A group closes only on ``)``, so a
    doomed match never re-partitions what it already consumed.

    Every channel renderer that turns a Markdown link into a platform link builds its
    destination from this unit, and so does the display-safety screen
    (``messaging.display_safety``), which has to collapse exactly the links a reader
    will see as links.

#:
#: Deliberately excludes the non-channel namespaces that also contain a colon
#: (``dashboard:``, ``cron:``, ``hook:``, ``subagent:``, ``channel:``) — those

#:
#: NOTE: ``autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES`` is a SEPARATE hand-kept copy. It is
#: often described as narrower; as of this writing it is not -- both hold the same
#: 11 namespaces. It answers a different question (does this key SHAPE belong to a
#: channel rather than a dashboard slot), which is why it lists namespaces nothing
#: can currently be delivered to. Deriving it from here would be sound and is
#: deliberately left out of the change that homed this roster; until then, do not
#: assume the two have diverged, and do not assume they are kept in step either.
#:
#: HOMED HERE, not in ``messaging.link``, because the roster has readers on both
#: sides of an import cycle. ``messaging.link`` is itself stdlib-only, but
#: importing anything from it executes ``messaging/__init__.py`` first, which
#: pulls in ``driver`` -> ``acp`` -> ``hooks``; a reader that ``hooks`` is already
#: mid-import for (``hooks`` -> ``webhooks`` -> ``validation``) then fails with a
#: partially-initialized ``hooks``. This module imports only ``os`` and ``re``, so
#: it can be read from anywhere. ``messaging.link`` re-exports both names, which

#: The channels an OWNER-DM may be inferred for -- ``send_message``'s channel
#: ``session`` values. A strict subset of :data:`CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES`, because
#: the two ask different questions and only one of them needs an owner.
#:
#: ``channel_type`` names a conversation: the one the calling session already
#: belongs to, or an explicit ``target_id`` the agent supplies. Neither infers a
#: recipient. A channel ``session`` DOES infer one, from
#: ``configured_targets()`` via ``_owner_dm_target``, whose safety claim is that
#: the agent can only reach somebody the USER configured.
#:
#: ``weixin`` and ``wecom`` are excluded because that claim is false on both. Each
#: folds identities LEARNED from inbound traffic into ``configured_targets()`` --
#: Weixin's ``_known_users`` (``_allowed | _known_users``) and WeCom's
#: ``_warm_chats``, which under ``wecom.allow_all_users`` become the list outright
#: ("there is no configured list to draw on, so the warm peers ARE the list"). So a
#: peer who messaged the bot once can be the single available direct target, which
#: is exactly what ``_owner_dm_target`` reads as "the owner". Nothing downstream
#: catches it: both transports' ``may_send_to`` returns True unconditionally under
#: their open policy (Weixin's promise to consult ``_allowed`` alone holds only on
#: its ``allowlist`` branch), and ``resolve_configured_target`` accepts the learned
#: set too. So private agent output would reach an arbitrary peer, not the operator.
#:
#: The other seven transports draw ``configured_targets()`` from configured state
#: alone; ``test_no_owner_dm_channel_advertises_learned_identities`` is the ratchet
#: that keeps this subtraction honest rather than hand-kept, so a transport that
#: starts mixing learned identities in fails the gate instead of silently becoming
#: an owner-DM target.
#:
#: This is a per-channel CAPABILITY gap, not drift: the exclusion is derived from
#: the send roster and carries its reason, the way ``slack`` and ``unified`` do. A
#: channel graduates by distinguishing configured recipients from learned peers in
#: ``configured_targets()`` -- at which point deleting it from this subtraction is
#: the whole change.
