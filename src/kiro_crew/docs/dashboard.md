# Web Dashboard

The dashboard is a React SPA at `http://localhost:5476` (or your configured URL). It provides chat, configuration, scheduled jobs, agent capabilities, and system/developer views.

## Accessing the Dashboard

- **Local**: open the dashboard URL after authenticating through a dashboard link; loopback requests are not exempt from token authentication.
- **SSH tunnel**: `ssh -NL 5476:localhost:5476 <host>` then open localhost:5476.
- **Remote**: type `!dashboard` in Slack to get an HMAC-SHA256-signed, IP-pinned, single-use link. The link is valid for 5 minutes and establishes a session cookie for up to 20 hours.
- **Custom domain**: after `kirocrew setup`, optionally use `http://kirocrew.localhost:5476`.
- **Custom URL**: set `dashboard.url` in config.json for non-localhost access.

### Remote Access Troubleshooting

If the dashboard doesn't load after setup:

1. Confirm the gateway is running: `kirocrew status`.
2. Test the API: `curl http://localhost:5476/api/status`.
3. Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :5476`.
4. On remote dev desktops, you must use an SSH tunnel — the dashboard binds to localhost by default.
5. Run `kirocrew gateway -vv` for debug output.

## Pages

### Chat (`/chat`)

Multi-session parallel chat with full Markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks, Mermaid diagrams, and clickable file paths. A confirmed local file link in an agent reply opens that file in the chat side panel; a `:line` suffix opens the file at that line instead of navigating the browser back to Chat.

- **Multiple tabs**: each tab runs its own agent session in parallel.
- **Agent selection**: pick an agent before starting a chat, or switch mid-session.
- **Session history**: closed sessions appear under **Older Sessions**, the collapsible footer at the bottom of the Sessions list on the left. Click the footer to expand it.
- **Resume**: click a session under Older Sessions to restore the full conversation.
- **Notifications**: click a notification to view it in the main pane.
- **Auto-titles**: sessions get auto-generated titles after a few turns.
- **Rename a session**: choose **Rename** from a sidebar row's `⋮` menu (or right-click the row), double-click the bold title in the row, or click the title in the session header. A name you set is kept: background title refreshes skip it, and only **Regenerate title** replaces it. **Regenerate title** sits on the session header (on hover) and in a sidebar row's `⋮` menu, so a stale name can be refreshed without opening the session.
- **Edit & resend**: edit and resend previous user messages with history preserved. From an empty composer, ⌘↑ (macOS) or Ctrl+↑ opens the last user message for editing.
- **Fork session**: fork a session into a new tab with full context carried over.
- **Merge a fork back**: on a fork, session menu → **Merge into parent…** drafts a summary of the fork's new messages, lets you edit it, and writes it into the chat it was forked from as a card that chat's agent reads on its next turn. The fork stays open; merging again covers only what is new. A fork cannot merge into a parent that takes turns outside the dashboard; the menu explains this on its greyed row.
- **Regenerate replies**: regenerate assistant replies with variant history navigation.
- **Prompt history**: ↑/↓ arrow keys navigate through previous prompts.
- **Tool purpose pills**: tool call labels show purpose text, persisted across reloads.
- **Batch tool rejection**: reject multiple pending tool approvals at once.
- **Cancel queued messages**: cancel button for messages waiting in the queue.
- **Edit queued messages**: edit a message waiting in the queue in place before it runs (order preserved); automatic recovery entries stay immutable so their delivery receipts remain bound to the original message.
- **iOS-style queue stack**: queued messages displayed as a visual stack.
- **Streaming transcription**: live speech-to-text partials via WebSocket.
- **Weighted content search**: session content search with weighted ranking.
- **Memory mode**: per-session choice — persistent (default), incognito (blocks learn_add), or temporary (no memory consolidation).
- **Merge queued messages**: optionally merge queued messages into a single prompt.
- **Cooperative stop**: soft-stop sends cancel first, falls back to hard kill after budget (preserves session state).
- **Tool input preview**: expandable tool input display in approval cards.
- **File upload**: on desktop, use **Upload file** from the `+` menu or drop a file into Chat. On a phone or other touch device, tap `+` to open the native system Files picker directly. Both paths accept images and regular files such as `.zip`, `.csv`, and `.docx`.
- **Folder management**: create, rename, and organize sessions into sidebar folders with indent borders.
- **Per-channel session folders**: optional, off by default — every messaging channel's settings panel can file conversations that start there into a named sidebar folder, marked with the channel's brand mark. Config key: `<channel>.session_folder` ("" = off). The folder is created when the setting is saved, so the surfacing path only ever reads the folder store; a configured folder that no longer exists (config.json hand-edited, or the folder deleted) leaves conversations unfiled until the next save recreates it. Filing applies as each conversation is first surfaced; a session moved by hand afterwards stays where it was put.
- **Session colors**: per-session color picker for visual organization.

### Settings (`/settings/*`)

Settings uses tabbed panels for Overview, Imports, Agent Harness, Chat, Display, Voice, Notifications, Shortcuts, Skills, Channels, Browser, Computer Use, Webhooks, Remote Crew, Privacy, Security, Connections, Secrets, Developer, Releases, and About. `/overview` redirects to `/settings/overview`.

### Customize (`/capabilities`)

Tabbed management for crewmates, custom agents, MCP connections, skills, the knowledge library, steering, hooks, prompts, and workflow libraries. `/agents`, `/connections` and `/knowledge` redirect here.

### Schedule (`/schedule`)

Create and manage cron jobs, organize them in folders, and switch between list, calendar, and execution views.

### Developer (`/developer`)

Tabbed developer views for logs, system metrics, telemetry, storage, MCP pooling, memory, configuration, debug tools, and the session archive. The former standalone `/system` page is the System tab here. The agent backend lives in **Settings → Agent Harness**; an old `/developer?tab=agent-backend` link forwards there.

### Logs (`/logs`)

Live gateway log stream with level selection, filtering, wrapping, ordering, and tail controls.

### Hooks (`/hooks`)

Create, edit, test, enable, and delete chat lifecycle hooks; provider hooks are displayed read-only when supported.

### Apps (`/apps`)

Browse discoverable apps, manage the installed-app library, and open app detail or migration views.

### Other shipped routes

`/knowledge` redirects to the Knowledge Library at `/capabilities?tab=knowledge`, `/notifications` opens notifications, `/artifacts` opens artifact management, and `/deploy` opens artifact deployment. Built-in app routes are registered dynamically.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard uses a single WebSocket connection for all real-time events: chat streaming, status updates, notifications, slot changes, and log streaming. Reconnects automatically with exponential backoff — no page reload needed.

## Terminal

Terminal tabs in the chat side panel host a real shell (PTY) bound to the chat's working directory. Each session has its own WebSocket at `/api/ws/terminal/{sessionId}`. Binary frames carry raw PTY I/O; JSON text frames carry control messages:

| Frame | Direction | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resize` | client → server | `{cols, rows}` | Viewport size change |
| `title` | server → client | `{text}` | Live tab title: foreground command name while one runs, else the shell cwd basename (polled ~1/s, pushed on change) |
| `cwd` | server → client | `{path}` | The shell's full live working directory (same poll, pushed on change) |
| `error` | server → client | `{message, code?}` | Session-level failure. `code: "displaced"` marks the one frame sent to a socket a newer connection has just replaced |
| `pong` | server → client | — | Keepalive reply |

Terminal routes are available only to the dashboard owner. When another window
belonging to that owner reconnects to the same terminal session, the newest
connection becomes its input and resize owner. The displaced connection can no
longer write to or resize the PTY; the server sends it one `error` frame
(`code: "displaced"`, `Another connection owns this terminal session`) and
closes that displaced WebSocket with bounded cleanup. The displaced window does
not redial on its own — an automatic redial would take the terminal straight
back and the two windows would displace each other in a loop — so it shows a
neutral banner reading "Another window took over this terminal" whose button reads "Use terminal here" (it takes the PTY back from the other window, which then parks the same way), and waits for
that button; network and tab-focus revives leave a displaced session
parked. Live `title`, `cwd` and `pong` frames are delivered only to the current
owner, and a frame that could not be delivered is retried on the next change
rather than marked sent. A reconnect that cannot replay current output or
receive its ready frame leaves the existing owner in place and also closes the
failed candidate without waiting indefinitely on its transport; a reconnect
with no live owner (a reload) always converges, even while the shell is
streaming output continuously.

**Selection toolbar.** Highlighting text in a terminal shows a floating toolbar with **Send to chat** and **Copy**. Send to chat appends the selection to the chat composer draft (never overwrites the draft, never auto-sends), annotated with a `Terminal output (path):` header — using the live `cwd` value when the backend has reported one, else the terminal's spawn directory — and wrapped in a code fence so the agent reads it as literal output. Copy places the raw selection on the clipboard.

**Credential redaction.** The terminal shows exactly what your shell wrote. The live stream is not scanned, so a token you printed on purpose (`gh auth token`), a device-code login or presigned URL you are mid-flow on, and high-entropy build output such as an npm `integrity sha512-…` line all render as themselves. Nothing is gained by hiding them here: this panel is your own interactive shell, and anything that could read it could read the terminal app next to it.

The scan runs where the output actually leaves your machine's screen — the selection hand-off above, the one path by which terminal output reaches the agent. That re-scan is unconditional, has no setting to disable it, and reads the whole contiguous selection rather than one 4096-byte read at a time, so a credential split across a read boundary cannot slip past it.
