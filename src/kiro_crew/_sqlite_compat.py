"""SQLite import shim + FTS5 capability probe.

KiroCrew's memory and knowledge stores require SQLite's FTS5 full-text
extension. We prefer ``pysqlite3`` (which bundles a recent SQLite with FTS5)
when present, and fall back to the stdlib ``sqlite3``.

``pysqlite3-binary`` only ships wheels for Linux x86_64 (see setup.cfg), so on
macOS and Linux aarch64 we rely on the host's stdlib SQLite having FTS5 built
in. Modern macOS and mainstream Linux distros do, but minimal container images
occasionally compile SQLite without ``SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5``. When that happens,
``CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ... USING fts5`` raises ``no such module: fts5`` — and a
naive delete-and-retry self-heal loops on the same failure forever. This module
provides a one-shot probe so callers can fail loudly with an actionable message
instead.

    The one escaping dialect for readers that quote a *tokenized* user query.
    A token becomes a quoted string, so FTS5 reads it as text rather than
    syntax: unquoted, ``-`` ``.`` and a bare ``AND`` are operators, which makes
    the everyday queries (``PROJ-123``, ``hooks.py``) raise inside the driver.
    Internal double quotes are doubled, the escape FTS5 defines for its own
    string literals.

    Returns the tokens rather than a finished expression: how they are joined is
    a per-surface product decision, not an escaping one. Memory search and
    knowledge item search AND them (the user typed every word deliberately);
    knowledge retrieval drops stopwords and ORs them (natural-language recall).

    Two other ``MATCH`` callers quote differently on purpose, and are not gaps
    waiting to be closed: the entity-items handler quotes one entity name as a
    single phrase rather than tokenizing it, and the personal-shopper store
    extracts word-character runs, which cannot contain the quote character this
    function escapes.
