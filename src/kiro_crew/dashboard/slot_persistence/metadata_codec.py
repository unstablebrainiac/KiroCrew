"""Every slot field a session's metadata line carries, both ways, in one table.

A dashboard slot's persisted state is the first line of its session file. Two save
forms write it -- the full save's rebuilt line and the empty-window merge -- and
three hydration purposes read it back onto a slot:

* ``RESTORE`` -- the open-tab restore and a targeted rehydrate
  (``chat_persistence._rehydrate_slot_from_history``);
* ``RECENT`` -- the boot restore of recent sessions
  (``chat_persistence._apply_recent_session``);
* ``RESUME`` -- a History resume and the transfer import
  (``chat_api.resume._hydrate_slot_from_history``).

:data:`FIELDS` is the table: one :class:`Field` per key, naming how each save form
writes it and which purposes take it back from the line. A purpose missing from a
row is a declared asymmetry. Each is kept exactly as the hand-written readers
behaved, and its ``why`` says what it costs; changing one is a product decision,
not a refactor.

The interface:

* :func:`slot_args` -- the ``get_or_create_slot`` keywords a purpose takes from
  the line (identity the constructor must see: app, origin, channel origin, a
  member pin);
* :func:`apply` -- every other field the purpose reads, in table order, once the
  slot exists. Its :class:`AppliedMeta` answers what the caller acts on itself (a
  tab id to persist, a relay that was mid-flight), and
  :meth:`AppliedMeta.settle` finishes the fields whose read needs the loaded
  window;
* :func:`encode` -- the line a save writes from slot state, in the form's key
  order, given the values the save folds against the disk (:class:`SaveFolds`).

The line is a file the agent's own tools can write. Each row's read keeps exactly
the checks its hand-written reader applied, no more and no fewer: some values are
re-validated (the title state, the compaction threshold, the dismissed links, the
model and effort, the mode, the custom color hex, the tags, the agent kind, the
artifact, the executor, the held notes, the queue), and the rest are still copied
as written.
New slot-owned metadata fields belong here: a row, its key in ``LINE_ORDER`` and
``MERGE_ORDER``, and in ``history.SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS`` when its absence must
clear it; ``test/test_slot_metadata_codec.py`` round-trips the row once
``_POPULATED`` sets it. Outside the table, ``channel_slots.surface_channel_session`` and the cron
binders still read a few fields of the line by hand.
