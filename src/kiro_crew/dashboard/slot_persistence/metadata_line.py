"""The metadata line a dashboard save writes, folded from the slot and the disk.

The first line of a session file carries the slot-owned fields (title, folder,
tags, model, mode and the rest), fields other layers own (carried through, a
durable execution record only ever tightened to the line's mode), and the privacy
contract every learning reader gates on (``memory_mode``). The slot-owned fields
and their key order are ``metadata_codec``'s; this module owns what a save folds
against the line on disk before it encodes them: the memory-mode ratchet and its
worker-to-loop witness, the monotonic newest-human-turn stamp, the bounded
dismissed source-link line, the held-note retirement, and the rows-only deferral.
``_save_slot_to_history`` decides when it runs.

New rules about what a save folds from the line it replaces belong here; new
slot-owned fields belong in ``metadata_codec``.
