"""The refusals and witnesses that keep a save from writing the wrong thing.

A save runs on a worker thread while the event loop keeps mutating the slot, and a
close, a rebind or a permanent delete can land between its snapshot and its write.
This module owns the checks that decide whether the write may go ahead: the paired
window/queue snapshot and its bounded retry, the stale-queue witness, the rule that
a refusal keeps the state owed, the delete witness (and the lock-free probes fork
and transfer ask before republishing a slot's content), and the registry that makes
a guarded truncating write visible to a close.

New refusal paths for a save belong here.

    The signal is the slot's own committed-queue witness, not a comparison

    The same delete witness as the delete-won guard in

    rely on observing the guard's ``False`` return: the periodic 5s flush can hit
    the guard first and clear ``_dirty``, after which those callers skip their
    own flush arm entirely and would act on the in-memory window. This probe
    answers directly, however the flush ordering fell out.

    Three answers, because two kinds of caller need them apart:

    * ``DELETED``: the file is gone, the file belongs to a NEW incarnation (an
      on-disk ``created_at`` other than the observed one), or the
      file vanished between the stat and the metadata read.
    * ``UNVERIFIABLE``: a stat failure other than ``FileNotFoundError``, an
      unreadable metadata line, or a metadata read that raises. Nothing shows
      the session is gone; nothing shows it is there either.
    * ``PRESENT``: the file is there and carries the identity this slot
      observed (or legacy metadata that records no identity, which fails OPEN
      by the documented rule).

    A caller that REPUBLISHES the slot's content (fork, transfer export) refuses
    on both ``DELETED`` and ``UNVERIFIABLE``, since either may be a deleted
    conversation copied from the surviving window: :func:`session_was_deleted`
    collapses them for those callers. A caller that has already WRITTEN into the
    transcript and is now deciding what to say needs them apart, because only
    ``DELETED`` means its write went with the session. Merge-back is that
    caller: its card is in the parent's durable hold before it asks, and the
    hold writer never merges into a metadata line whose identity is not the one
    its slot observed, so after a committed write only a delete proven since
    says the card is lost. An unverifiable read is no evidence of one, and
    answering "deleted" for it would deny a merge that landed.

    Same evidence rule as the guard: the slot must have OBSERVED its file on
    disk (``_disk_meta_created_at`` non-empty, or the ``_disk_meta_observed``
    bit for legacy metadata that records no ``created_at``, both recorded at the
    hydrate sites and at committed saves, nowhere else), so a fresh slot is
    never deleted, and a log without a path resolver cannot witness a delete;
    both answer ``PRESENT``. An EMPTY ``created_at`` is re-stated before it is
    trusted: being lock-free, this probe can have the delete land between its
    stat and its metadata read, and a file that has just vanished reads back as
    a genuine ``({}, True)``, so the empty answer alone cannot tell "legacy
    metadata" (fails open) from "deleted a moment ago" (``DELETED``).

    Lock-free: a permanent delete never un-happens, so ``DELETED`` is stable; a
    ``PRESENT`` can race a delete landing right after, which is the same
    residual as a delete landing right after the caller's own copy or write.

    # on-loop callers to a worker thread that takes the PATIENT
    # acquire, so this save can legitimately sit waiting while a
    # permanent delete runs to completion ahead of it — writing now
    # would silently undo a delete that already reported success,
    # resurrecting the conversation in Older Sessions. A missing
