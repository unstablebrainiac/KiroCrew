"""Session persistence — save, restore, history prefix.

A dashboard slot's conversation lives in one session JSONL file: a metadata line
followed by the transcript rows. This module is the facade every caller imports
from, and it keeps the orchestration that has to stay together:

* the save transaction, ``_save_slot_to_history``: snapshot, refusals, the
  transcript lock, the atomic replace and the witness stamping, with its on-loop
  entry point ``save_slot_off_loop`` and the close fence it applies;
* the restore drivers and slot builders: ``restore_open_slots``,
  ``restore_recent_sessions``, their async twins, ``_rehydrate_slot_from_history``,
  ``_apply_recent_session`` and the prefetch reads they share;
* process-wide state with the code that mutates it: the reasoning-effort
  allowlist, and the persisted-entry memo ``_build_message_entry`` with its bounds;
* the private member-store assignment and the request-side retired-mode coercion.

The rules those consult are composed from :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.slot_persistence`:
``write_guards`` (the save's refusals and witnesses), ``metadata_codec`` (every
slot field of the metadata line, written and read back through one table),
``metadata_line`` (what a save folds against the line on disk before it encodes),
``transcript_merge`` (frozen prefix, foreign appends, payload), ``message_entries``
(row projection), ``restore_inputs`` (restore-time reads and screens) and
``turn_marker`` (the turn-in-flight marker). The slot builders construct and fill a
slot through ``metadata_codec``; the window replay and the rollback stay here. Every
project name this module bound before the owners were composed is still importable
from here, and the names tests rebind on this module are read through it at call
time, so such a patch reaches the code that moved.

    Restoring a tab reads and redacts a transcript, so a user with many large
    tabs can spend tens of seconds in here. Doing that synchronously monopolizes
    the event loop — and because ``_loop_heartbeat`` pets the
    ``LoopStallWatchdog`` *from a coroutine*, a blocked loop cannot pet it. The
    watchdog's 25s ``exit_after`` timer then fires, dumps thread stacks and
    ``_exit``s the gateway, which is exactly the observed startup crash-loop: the
    app never finished booting.

    Yielding between tabs (the ``sleep(0)`` below) was the first fix and is kept:
    it bounds how long any ONE tab can hold the loop. But it only ever moved the
    boundary — the whole per-tab read still ran ON the loop, so a single large
    transcript could stall it for seconds before the next yield arrived. So the
    reads themselves now move: ``open_slots.json``, the agent→model map, and each
    tab's metadata + chained transcript walk are hoisted into
    ``asyncio.to_thread``, and only the slot mutation stays here.

    That mutation cannot follow them. Creating a slot broadcasts via
    ``asyncio.Queue.put_nowait`` / ``asyncio.Event.set``, neither of which is
    thread-safe, and ``_spawn_ws_send``'s ``ensure_future`` raises off-loop into
    a broad ``except`` that marks every connected dashboard client dead and drops
    it *without a close frame* — browsers then never reconnect. So this driver
    runs its own prefetch-then-apply loop (the shape
    ``rehydrate_slot_from_history_async`` established) rather than driving
    :func:`_restore_open_slots_steps`, whose reads are inline by construction.
    The generator stays for the synchronous callers.

    Because this yields, the 5s periodic flush (already running by this point)
    can interleave — so ``restoring_open_slots`` is held for the duration to stop
    it snapshotting a half-restored slot set over open_slots.json.

    """:func:`_rehydrate_slot_from_history` with the disk reads off the loop.

    Same contract and return values as the synchronous form, including
    returning ``None`` for a session the user closed with ✕.

    Why split rather than simply wrapping the whole thing in
    ``asyncio.to_thread``: slot construction is loop-affine. It reaches
    ``get_or_create_slot`` → ``push_slots_update`` → ``_broadcast``, which uses
    ``asyncio.Queue.put_nowait`` and ``Event.set`` — neither thread-safe — and
    ``_spawn_ws_send``'s ``ensure_future`` raises off-loop. That raise lands in
    a broad ``except`` that marks every connected dashboard client dead and
    drops it *without a close frame*, so browsers never reconnect and stop
    receiving frames until a manual reload. ``restore_open_slots_async``
    documents the same invariant.

    So only the reads move: the metadata line, the chained message walk (tens of
    MB of read plus JSON parse on a large session) and the agent→model map.
    Everything that touches slot state runs on the loop, as the synchronous
    callers do. The reads are shared with the two bulk restore drivers via
    :func:`_prefetch_rehydrate_inputs`, so all three prefetch identically.

    Because the read is offloaded, the state it observed can be stale by the time
    the build runs. Both post-hop windows are re-checked below, synchronously and
    immediately before the build so no await can reopen them: the close tombstone
    (a ✕ during the read) and :func:`_deletion_during_read` (the session deleted,
    or deleted and recreated, during the read). Returning ``None`` for either is
    part of the contract — the callers already handle a ``None`` result.

    A rebuilt slot also gets its MCP-app claim recovery here, so every caller has
    it without asking; see the comment at that call for why it is not each
    caller's job.

# Memoisation for :func:`_build_message_entry`. ``_save_slot_to_history``
# re-serializes the WHOLE in-memory window on every flush (see the comment inside
# the uncached builder), so each save re-runs redaction over every message in the
# window -- including the overwhelming majority that have not changed since the
# previous flush. Redaction is the expensive part: two passes over the content,
# the same two passes again over EACH variant, plus a meta pass.
#
# The key is a content hash of the WHOLE message rather than an identity or a
# field subset, which is what makes invalidation automatic and total: the slot
# mutates messages in place (a stop event resolving, a file-change chip landing,
# a banner completing), and any such edit changes the digest, so the next call
# misses and recomputes instead of serving a stale entry. There is deliberately
# no explicit invalidation hook to forget.
#
# Bound sizing: a save re-serializes one slot's entire window, so the live
# working set is roughly ``active_slots x window_size`` and the failure mode past
# the bound is a cliff rather than a slope -- each save walks its window in
# order, so with several slots taking turns the LRU evicts each window just
# before its next save and the hit rate collapses to zero instead of degrading.
# The default entry bound holds several concurrent slot windows; because the
# right size is host-dependent (a gateway with many active slots overflows the
# entry bound while the byte bound still has headroom), both the entry bound and
# the byte ceiling are configurable
# (``dashboard.chat_entry_cache_max_entries`` / ``chat_entry_cache_max_bytes``).
#
# The flush site skips the cache for a window longer than the entry bound, which
# closes that cliff for ONE oversized window and nothing more. Several slots
# whose COMBINED windows exceed the bound each stay under it individually, so
# they take the cached path and hit the same zero-hit cliff unguarded. Detecting
# that needs a live view across slots, which no single save has; the mitigation
# is the configurable entry bound above -- an operator whose host shows the
# multi-slot cliff raises it -- while the cost of the residual case is only the
# key derivation on a miss.
#
# The entry count alone does NOT bound memory, because an entry is as large as
# its message: a cache full of megabyte-sized messages would retain gigabytes.
# That retention outlives the slot, since the entry holds the SAME content string
# object as the message rather than a copy, so a closed slot's window can be
# freed while the cache keeps its content alive. Hence two further bounds: a
# per-entry ceiling above which an entry is computed but never stored (so one
# huge message cannot evict the whole cache), and a total-byte ceiling evicted
# alongside the entry count. Worst-case retention is the lesser of
# ``max_entries x _ENTRY_MAX_CACHEABLE_BYTES`` and the configured byte ceiling.
#
# Size is measured as the length of the key payload, which the front door has
# already built for hashing, so it costs nothing extra. It measures the input
# rather than the built entry, but the entry is derived from it and the two track
# each other within a small factor -- accurate enough for a memory ceiling.
#
# Two properties work in our favour: entries are content-keyed, so two slots
# holding identical message content share one entry; and a cached ``None`` (a
# transient role) is a legitimate value, so membership -- not truthiness -- is
# what distinguishes a hit from a miss.

# ``_ENTRY_MAX_CACHEABLE_BYTES`` stays a module constant: it guards against ONE
# huge message evicting the whole cache, a shape that does not vary by host the

    on its next tick. The forced route saves (tag, folder, pin, transfer) keep
    committing their merge unconditionally, so none of them can newly report an
    acknowledged edit as refused.

    The session file is modeled as **frozen prefix + live window**:

    - The **frozen prefix** is the first ``slot._disk_older_count`` on-disk
      message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window (set at
      restore/resume). These bytes are read verbatim and NEVER rewritten, so a
      restart that loaded only a recent window can no longer destroy older
      history.
    - The **live window** is ``slot.messages`` (small, ~500 messages). It is
      re-serialized in full on every save. Re-serializing the whole window means
      in-place edits to already-shown messages (stop-event resolution, file-change
      chips, mcp_oauth banner completion) and any reordering done by
      ``_flush_segment`` all persist correctly — there is no position counter to
      get out of sync.

    The default save writes ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(window)``.

    Pass ``rewrite=True`` (or an explicit *messages* snapshot, which implies it)
    for operations that INTENTIONALLY truncate the window (rewind/regenerate/
    fork): the file is rebuilt as ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(snapshot)``
    and the dropped window tail is archived first via ``_archive_dropped_lines``.

    Concurrency: ``_flush_dirty_slots`` runs this in an executor thread
    while ``_run_chat`` mutates ``slot.messages`` on the event loop. We snapshot
    ``list(slot.messages)`` (a single GIL-atomic attribute read) and the matching
    ``slot._disk_older_count`` up front, then operate only on that snapshot, so a
    concurrent ``_flush_segment`` reassigning ``slot.messages`` cannot interleave
    with the read-serialize-write and skip/duplicate a message.

    Operates ONLY on this slot's own single session file (``_path(history_key)``);
    tab_id chaining is 1:1 (a slot's tab_id maps to exactly one file — fork makes
    a fresh slot with its own file), so this never reads/writes a sibling and
    legacy no-tab_id sessions stay isolated.

    ``rows_only``: persist the window but leave the metadata line's slot-owned
    fields as they are on disk, keeping authority over only
    :data:`~kiro_crew.history.ROWS_ONLY_OWNED_META_KEYS`. It exists for the one
    caller whose slot is not the transcript's only writer: the close/cleanup
    hand-over drain, which writes a popped slot's unsaved rows onto a transcript a
    concurrent same-key replacement now holds. The default rebuild would revert
    whatever that replacement had already published (a folder or a pinned title
    from ``POST /api/chat/slots``, a tag, a pin), so the rows move and the line does
    not. The deferred set is
    :data:`~kiro_crew.history.ROWS_ONLY_DEFERRED_META_KEYS`, which is wider than the
    owned fields alone: a title's provenance and refresh budget describe the title
    and travel with it. It includes ``closed``/``closed_at``, so an open-shaped
    rows-only write does not erase a dismissal the replacement committed while this
    one was in flight.

    The deferral is conditional on there being another writer to defer to, decided
    from the line's ``tab_id``: a line this slot published itself, or no line at
    all, gets the ordinary rebuild. Otherwise the flag would cost the popped slot
    its own uncommitted metadata — an edit is acknowledged when it lands in memory
    and persists on a later flush, and after the pop no flush ever visits that slot
    again.

    ``expected_disk_older_count`` pairs an explicit *messages* snapshot with the
    ``slot._disk_older_count`` the caller observed in the SAME synchronous stretch
    it froze that snapshot in. A snapshot is internally consistent by
    construction, but the frozen-prefix boundary it must be written against is
    not: a concurrent ``append`` at the window cap trims the front and credits
    the trimmed rows to ``_disk_older_count``, so a snapshot frozen before that
    trim, written against the counter read after it, emits those rows twice —
    once in the frozen prefix and once at the head of the snapshot. Supplying the
    paired count makes that drift refuse the save (``False``, nothing written)
    instead of committing a duplicated transcript; a caller that reads the live
    counter itself cannot detect the drift at all. Ignored without *messages*,
    where the bounded retry below already takes both halves together.

    Returns ``False`` when the delete-won guard aborted the save because the
    session was permanently deleted while this save awaited the lock, when
    ``expected_history_key`` no longer matches the slot's routing, or when
    ``expected_disk_older_count`` drifted — the in-memory window was NOT
    persisted and must not be treated as durable. Every other completion
    (including the benign no-op skips) returns ``True``.

    """Persist a slot from the event loop without blocking or dropping the save.

    :func:`_save_slot_to_history` holds the per-session cross-process
    ``_locked`` across its read-modify-``atomic_write``. That lock, invoked on
    the gateway event loop, makes a single
    non-blocking acquire and raises :class:`~kiro_crew.history.HistoryLockTimeout`
    under any concurrent holder (e.g. a workflow/cron result appending via
    :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`) — so calling the save inline on
    the loop would both risk a disk write on the loop and drop the save under
    benign contention, or surface the timeout into the aiohttp handler.

    This helper mirrors :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`: on a running
    loop it dispatches the save to a worker thread so it takes the *patient*
    off-loop acquire path; off the loop it saves inline.

    ``best_effort`` (default ``True``): a lock timeout / I/O error is logged and
    the slot is marked ``_dirty`` so the periodic flush retries the write — the
    in-memory slot is the source of truth. This retry re-arm matters for the
    metadata mutation endpoints (pin / folder / tag / mode), which call this with
    ``force=True`` but do not otherwise mark the slot dirty: without it a
    swallowed failure would drop an acknowledged edit with no retry, losing it
    after a restart. Pass ``best_effort=False`` for archival paths (session
    close/cleanup) that must CONFIRM the durable write succeeded before removing
    the session: the save still runs off-loop (patient acquire), but any
    exception propagates so the caller can roll back and keep the slot.

    ``expected_history_key``: the transcript key the caller authorized its
    mutation against. The save refuses (returns ``False``, nothing written)
    when the slot's routing no longer resolves to that key at write time -- a
    rebind on the event loop can land between the caller's authorization and
    the worker's routing snapshot, and without this pin the durable write
    would target a transcript the caller never authorized.

    ``expected_slot_name``: the ``state._slots`` map key the caller checked its
    slot object against before dispatching. The save refuses (returns ``False``,
    nothing written) when the map holds a different slot object at the locked
    commit boundary -- a same-name close-and-recreate that resumes the
    same transcript keeps ``expected_history_key`` identical and slips past the
    routing pin, so this object-identity recheck under the lock stops the
    truncating snapshot from landing on the replacement's transcript.

    ``rows_only``: write the window but leave the metadata line's slot-owned
    fields as they stand on disk when the line was published by ANOTHER slot --
    for a caller persisting a slot's rows onto a transcript another live slot now
    holds. See :func:`_save_slot_to_history` for the full contract, including the
    ``tab_id`` test that keeps the flag from deferring to the caller's own line.

    Returns ``False`` only when the save was skipped WITHOUT writing: the
    session was permanently deleted while the save awaited the lock (the
    delete-won guard in :func:`_save_slot_to_history`), or the routing moved
    off ``expected_history_key``. A guarded write is also skipped when the slot
    is already fenced for close, because the retraction of its name has passed
    the point where it can wait for this write -- unless the retraction itself
    issued it (``issued_by_the_retraction``), which the handover drain does and
    nothing else does. Neither skip raises, for either
    ``best_effort`` mode, so a clean return does NOT prove a committed write.
    Callers that go on to republish the slot's content elsewhere (fork, the
    transfer export) must check the return; archival callers (close/cleanup)
    may ignore it — the delete already disposed of what they were archiving.
