    Redaction is regex-heavy and holds the GIL, so it must run where a yield
    corrupts nothing -- BEFORE any slot exists -- and it must be bounded by the
    rows that actually enter the live window, not the whole transcript.

    ``window_limit`` mirrors the materialiser's own windowing: only the newest
    ``window_limit`` rows become the live window that is re-serialized on the next
    save, so only those need redacting here. The older prefix is the FROZEN
    prefix -- already redacted at the write boundary, left verbatim on disk, and
    used only for ``_disk_older_count`` accounting (its content is never
    re-serialized) -- so redacting it would be transcript-sized GIL work on the
    loop for bytes that are never rewritten. Resume passes 500, so its cost is
    bounded by the window regardless of transcript length; import passes ``None``
    (every row enters the window and is persisted by its own save), and runs this
    off the loop (``asyncio.to_thread``) so its larger pass yields freely.

    Read-side redaction is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH, not the primary protection: non-user
    content is redacted at the write boundary (``chat_runner``), so this covers
    rows written before a redaction rule existed, a hand-edited or legacy JSONL,
    or any write path that bypassed the boundary. It must not be dropped.

    User rows are left untouched (matching the write boundary, which redacts
    non-user text). A non-string ``content`` (legacy/corrupt JSONL, or nested
    multi-part content) is NORMALISED to a single redacted string by
    ``_normalise_structured_content`` rather than being passed through
    unredacted or kept as structure: resume is reachable for such rows precisely
    because this pass is defense-in-depth for transcripts a write-time rule never
    covered, so leaving a non-string row unscrubbed would let a credential in
    nested content (a value OR a dict key) reach a broadcaster, and keeping the
    structure would crash the downstream save/display paths that redact
    ``content`` as a string. Row dicts in the redacted window are shallow-copied so the

    either. Prefix rows are returned as-is.

    This is the single materialisation path shared by two callers: the History
    resume endpoint (:func:`api_chat_slot_resume`) and the transfer importer
    (:func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.session_transfer.api_chat_slot_import`). Install
    lands the transcript, metadata line and Layer B on disk and then routes
    through here, so "install a session" and "pull a stale session up off disk"
    are the SAME operation rather than two slot-construction paths that drift.

    The inputs are exactly the intersection the two callers share: a resolved
    slot key, the transcript key, a validated metadata snapshot, and the loaded
    transcript rows. It reads nothing from the request, and — this is the
    load-bearing constraint of the fold (RFC section 7.1b) — it applies exactly
    the metadata field set resume applies and DOES NOT apply
    ``executor`` / ``instance_id`` / ``remote_slot``. A session bound to a remote
    instance therefore comes back LOCAL when materialised here, which is the
    behaviour to preserve: rehydrating the remote binding is the startup restore
    path's job (``_rehydrate_slot_from_history`` in chat_persistence), not this
    one. Do not add remote-binding application here "for consistency" — that is
    the prohibited change, and it is pinned by a test.

    ``member_binding`` / ``folder_unhidden`` / ``folder_checked_id`` are verdicts
    the RESUME guards produce; import passes their no-op defaults (no member key,
    no folder to unhide). ``request_title`` is resume's client-supplied name,
    used only when the persisted metadata carries no title; import writes its
    marked title into the metadata line and passes ``""`` here.

    ``window_limit`` and ``disk_meta_observed`` are facts about the DATA, not
    caller switches. ``window_limit`` is how many newest rows to surface as the
    live window given that earlier rows are already durable elsewhere: resume's
    rows are a window onto a longer on-disk transcript (cap 500, the rest frozen
    on disk), and import writes its older rows to the transcript as the frozen
    prefix before its save and passes the same cap. ``None`` surfaces every row,
    for a caller whose rows are all persisted by the save itself.
    ``disk_meta_observed`` is whether this hydration read an existing transcript
    off disk: resume did (True), import synthesised its metadata (False), and it
    gates the delete-won disk-identity bookkeeping that only means something for a
    real disk read.

    ``broadcast_rows`` and ``mint_missing_mids`` are likewise facts about the
    rows. ``broadcast_rows`` is whether hydrating a row should emit a live
    ``chat_message`` SSE event: resume is an interactive open (True), import is a
    silent replay of a bundle onto a slot that stays REGISTERED and under
    construction throughout its (synchronous) hydration and is retracted from
    ``_slots`` only afterwards, for the async finalization tail; import passes
    False (matching the tunnel importer and the ``append`` docstring's
    list of replay callers) — broadcasting would push an under-construction
    slot's peer content to every client and retire live question cards. ``mint_missing_mids``
    is whether these rows need message ids minted: resume's disk rows already
    carry mids (False), import's bundle rows have none, so it passes True or the
    imported rows land permanently id-less and drop out of mid-keyed features.

    Loads NOTHING itself: ``all_messages`` is handed in ALREADY CONTENT-REDACTED
    by the caller's pre-construction pass (``_redact_history_rows``), because the
    two callers answer "where do the bytes come from" differently — resume reads
    the disk transcript under its own TOCTOU ordering, import redacts and lands
    the bundle. It returns the slot built and hydrated but NOT yet published: it
    stays REGISTERED in ``state._slots`` (so a concurrent same-key resume resolves
    it and dedups) and is held under ``begin_slot_construction``, which keeps it
    out of the serialized payload. Each caller owns its own admission accounting
    and must, at its own tail, call ``end_slot_construction(slot.key)`` and
    ``push_slots_update()`` exactly once to make it visible.

    SYNCHRONOUS. Construction contains no ``await``: content redaction (the only
    regex-heavy, GIL-holding, content-scaling work) runs in the caller's
    pre-construction pass, BEFORE any slot exists, where a yield can corrupt
    nothing. The remaining loop is append + provenance + variant attach, measured
    at single-digit milliseconds even at the transfer bounds (5,000 rows / 20M
    chars) — far under the loop-stall watchdog. Being synchronous is what makes
    the slot unobservable mid-build: no acquirer, serializer or persister runs
    between ``begin_slot_construction`` and ``end_slot_construction`` on the loop,
    and construction is loop-affine (threaded persistence snapshots the window on
    the loop first), so no half-hydrated window is ever seen — no guard needed.
    """
    # Create the slot and mark it under construction inside ONE synchronous
    # ``suspend_slots_push`` block. ``get_or_create_slot`` registers the slot and
    # fires a leading-edge ``push_slots_update()`` before it returns; deferring
    # that push until ``begin_slot_construction`` has run means the single
    # coalesced broadcast at block exit serializes the slot as already under
    # construction, so ``serialize_slots`` hides it. Both statements are
    # synchronous — no ``await`` inside — so the process-global suspend counter is
    # never held across a yield (holding it across the hydrate loop's yields would
    # swallow every other slot mutation on the gateway for the duration).
    # Rollback-protected region covers creation, the construction mark, AND the
    # ``suspend_slots_push`` block exit: that exit flushes the deferred
    # ``push_slots_update()``, which can raise on a pre-existing poisoned slot
    # (a non-serializable field) BEFORE hydration begins. If any of it raises,
    # the except path releases the construction count and drops the slot, so a
    # failed materialisation never leaks a hidden-but-registered slot that
    # consumes capacity for the process lifetime. ``slot`` may be unbound if

    The request-free core behind ``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/resume``; the
    session-control ``revive`` verb reaches the same path so a controlled revive
    and a human click in the History tab share one materialisation, one set of
    guards and one set of refusal codes. ``name`` is the slot key to publish
    under (any spelling ``_normalize_slot_key`` folds), ``history_key`` the
    transcript to load (``None`` means ``name``), ``request_app`` the app token's
    scope when the caller is an app (empty for the dashboard user and for
    session control), ``caller_label`` what SEL records as the caller,
    ``request_title`` the fallback title when the transcript stores none, and
    ``expected_created_at`` an optional transcript identity that must match before
    an existing or hydrated slot is returned.

    ``containment`` is a caller's LAST gate before publish. It runs once the slot
    is hydrated -- so it reads the fields the slot actually carries, not a
    metadata snapshot from before the transcript read -- and before the slot is
    published, with the slot RETRACTED from ``state._slots`` and its construction
    mark held for the duration (the import path's posture for an awaited tail):
    nothing resolves it, ``serialize_slots`` never shows it, and a named create on
    its key is refused by the construction guard. A refusal it returns discards
    the built slot the way a failed construction is discarded and comes back as
    ``ResumeOutcome.refusal``. With a hook the reopen write (clearing ``closed``)
    is deferred until the hook has passed, so a hook refusal has nothing durable
    to undo, and a clear that cannot land refuses (``reopen_failed``) rather than
    publishing a tab that would not restore. The hook is an idempotent pre-publish
    check (it may update in-memory bookkeeping such as ``_created_by`` and
    ``_revived_by`` on the built slot, never durable state) and runs TWICE: once before the deferred clear, and once after it as the last
    awaiting act, because the clear and its verification read are awaits during
    which a store-recorded channel binding could land, and ``final_check`` may not
    read the store. The existence and ``created_at`` identity barrier is re-run
    after each of those awaits, the last time synchronously, so a delete or a
    delete-and-recreate inside the window is refused rather than published over
    the replacement, and the marker rollback only ever targets the transcript
    this resume read. The folder un-hide keeps the
    hook-less path's place, before construction: a refused resume can leave a
    folder visible, as a click refused at the member barrier already can.
    ``final_check`` is the SYNCHRONOUS last word, run after the last await and
    immediately before the publish, for the hook's store-free answers (slot
    fields, caps); a refusal there restores the marker the deferred clear just
    dropped. Nothing is published on any refusal. A human click passes neither.

    Refusals come back as :class:`ResumeOutcome.refusal` rather than being
    raised, because the wire wrapper reproduces each one's historical body and
    status and a session-control caller maps them onto its own error class.
